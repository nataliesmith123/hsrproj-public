# a-b and b-a linkages are still in here -- that's ok, we will fix this in the next step 
# wouldn't even be a big deal if we didn't fix it, since for visualization purposes our edges would lay on top of each other
# only thing it would affect is the community detection algorithm, and it would be consistent across all edges
