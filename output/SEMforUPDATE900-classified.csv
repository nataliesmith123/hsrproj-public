20201115,Scalable tools to effectively translate genomic discoveries into the clinic,"We are in the midst of a genomic revolution; more than 250,000 human genomes have been sequenced, generating over a petabase of genomic data. While these new data hold great promise to impact health, there is a disconnect between genomic discovery and clinical care. Providers frequently misinterpret genomic information, patients often don't understand their own test results, and genomic information about disease risk is infrequently shared between patients and family members. Importantly, ineffective communication and data misinterpretation have devastating consequences--including unnecessary organ removal, missed disease prevention opportunities, and premature death. We are addressing these genomic care gaps by developing and testing tools that optimize the integration of whole exome and whole genome sequencing (WES, WGS) for general clinical practice. My vision for improving genomic medicine is based on my work within multidisciplinary consortia and addresses the National Human Genome Research Institute's priority research area of improving the effectiveness of health care. In the proposed work we will test the effectiveness of a multilevel genomic e-Health intervention in cancer (aim 1). Our intervention 1) educates physicians and patients about genomics, 2) enables direct-to-patient return-of-results, 3) provides physicians with patient-specific results and resources for interpretation, and 4) facilitates sharing of genomic results within families. We hypothesize that intervention use will result in higher rates of uptake of high-quality, genetically guided care. We will test our hypothesis in a randomized controlled trial among academic and community physicians who use WES for their patients. Next, we will use an iterative process, with stakeholder engagement, to adapt and pilot test our tool for Spanish- and Mandarin-speaking patients and for patients who have diabetes (aim 2). Finally, we will create and assess new, moderated social networks as a platform for genomic information sharing (aim 3). Our hypothesis is that providers, patients, and family members will engage with the genomic information sharing social networks and find them to be highly useful. Our general approach includes 1) creating the secure social networks; 2) integrating the networks into our e-Health intervention; and 3) using complementary methods, such as interviews and natural language processing, to assess stakeholders' network-related attitudes and network information quality. If successful, we will be well positioned to widely disseminate our e-Health tools. In sum, this work stands to transform how people obtain, process, and share genomic information in the context of clinical care. Our tools reconceive genetic communication to allow for multidirectional flow of information, connects multiple stakeholders with one another, and integrates high-quality dynamic web-based resources to improve genomic care. In creating and deploying tools that both respond to and leverage the complexities of our information environment, we intend to transform genomic research and clinical practice.",1,,1,,,,,,social networks and pt provider comm about genets,0
20201266,"Evidence for value-based prescription drug plan for diabetes, CVD, and chronic illness","Value-based insurance design (VBID) is widely viewed as an important tool to improve the health of consumers and the efficiency of health care spending in the U.S. VBID has found its widest applicability with respect to prescription drugs, and the potential of VBID may be greatest for elderly persons with chronic illnesses such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease that are effectively treated with prescription drugs. The essential feature of a VBID is the fact that prescription drugs may be substitutes or complements with other health care services. Therefore, changes in the use of prescription drugs, for example, because of changes in cost sharing, may affect health and alter use of other health care services. While conceptually appealing, the evidence to support VBID is lacking. Specifically, an effective VBID requires knowledge of the following: the effect of cost sharing on prescription drugs on the use of prescription drugs, the effect of cost sharing on prescription drugs on use of other health care services, and the effect of cost sharing on prescription drugs on health. While some evidence related to each of these links in the causal chain exists, it is not sufficiently detailed to design an effective ""value-based"" prescription drug benefit plan. Our proposed research will provide evidence that will fill in much of the existing knowledge gaps and be instrumental in advancing the scientific base of evidence to inform future VBID, for example, as envisioned in the ""Model Test"" program initiated by Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS). The proposed research will exploit the large and widespread changes over time in consumer cost sharing within Medicare Part D plans to estimate the causal association between cost sharing and use of prescription drugs among the elderly, particularly among those with chronic illnesses such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease. We will then exploit the changes in consumer cost sharing to estimate the causal association between cost sharing and use of health care services other than prescription drugs, and cost sharing and health. These aims directly address the specific hypotheses described in PA-17-088: ""Differences in health outcomes between alternative treatment regimens or health care management strategies for older patients with specific common conditions in old age, or with specific combinations of two or more chronic conditions."" The research also focuses on the target population of PA-17-088: ""Groups identified by disease or non-disease status for comparison analyses (e.g., hip fracture patients) either retrospectively for risk factors (e.g., case-control studies) or prospectively for health-related outcomes. Groups defined by administrative databases to explore specific hypotheses regarding aging changes across the lifespan or diagnosis and management of medical conditions common among the elderly (e.g., CMS data, managed and/or accountable care organization data, health insurance databases, electronic health records, etc.).""",1,,,,,1,,,value based insurance design,0
20201089,Pragmatics to Reveal Intention in Social Media (PRISM) for health promotion,"The effects of social relationships on management of health behaviors and adoption of positive wellness regimens has been well documented. In the era of digital and participatory health communication, the role of social ties in health promotion has become more complex. Online communities, which digitize peer-to-peer communication, provide a unique opportunity to researchers to understand collective social mechanisms as well as individual factors underlying human behavior change. Most studies of online and offline social networks have not considered the dynamics among communication intent and content with social influence. In the proposed research, we will develop a multi-dimensional methodological framework for social intercourse analysis to leverage the rich and voluminous data provided by online communities. Our framework aims to incorporate and integrate communication intent, semantics, and structure of online communication to study sociobehavioral factors of health behaviors and chronic disease management. While our methods will be generally applicable, we will develop them in the context of health-related communication between members of online communities, particularly focusing on smoking cessation and diabetes management. This research proposal will result in 1) new theoretical frameworks that describe the communication domain in an online social setting for behavior change; 2) scalable techniques to model expressions, semantics, and social dependencies associated self-reported health outcomes; and 3) new proposals for the development of data-driven sociobehavioral interventions to support individuals engaging in positive health behavior changes and chronic disease management.",1,,1,,,,,,social relationships,0
20201448,Restricted mean survival time to interpret clinical trials for treatment decision making in older adults,"Patient-centered care of older adults with multimorbidity involves shared decision making based on accurate communication of evidence. In clinical trials, treatment effect is conventionally summarized in terms of relative risk reduction using hazard ratios and absolute risk reduction. Despite widespread use, these conventional measures based on probabilities are not well understood by clinical community and often misleading in treatment decision making. We have recently proposed restricted mean survival time (RMST) as a patient-centric outcome metric that can be intuitively interpreted as the average event-free survival time up to a prespecified time point. Treatment effect can be summarized using RMST difference, which means ""gain or loss in event-free survival time due to treatment in a prespecified period."" Since it is expressed on a time scale that most clinicians and patients can relate to, it has great potential to facilitate shared decision making in older adults, which involves assessment of benefit within a defined time frame, such as the remaining life expectancy. The objective of this application is to determine the usefulness of RMST in treatment decision making, using an example of intensive vs. standard blood pressure lowering strategies in older adults. Our hypothesis is that presenting evidence using RMST difference, rather than absolute and relative risk reduction, would be more effective in reducing patients' uncertainty about treatment choice. To test our hypothesis, we will accomplish 2 specific aims to 1) determine the benefit of intensive vs. standard blood pressure lowering strategies using RMST difference in older adults and identify characteristics associated with a greater RMST benefit; and 2) evaluate the effect of evidence communication formats based on RMST difference vs. conventional measures on patients' uncertainty in treatment decision making. For aim 1, we will analyze 2 publicly available datasets from the Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes Trial and Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial to estimate RMST difference. For aim 2, we will conduct an online survey of 200 community-dwelling older adults and an in-person survey of 100 residents at a local senior housing site. Participants will be randomized to one of the 2 evidence presentation formats, RMST vs. conventional measures, to assess the effect on reducing uncertainty in decision making. We will conduct focus group interviews of 20-30 survey participants to further understand the reasoning and context behind their choice. Our approach is innovative, because we apply an intuitive and methodologically robust RMST to analyze and interpret clinical trial data, and rigorously evaluate the acceptability and understanding from the patient's perspective by adopting quantitative and qualitative design. The impact of this research is expected to be significant, because our method has great potential to be generalized to other clinical trials with time-to-event endpoints to facilitate shared decision making in older adults.",1,1,,,,,,,delivery of information to patients,0
20202056,BEST-VIVA registry (vCLI),"Critical limb ischemia (CLI), a lack of blood flow to the leg characterized by leg pain at rest or by tissue loss, affects approximately 2 million Americans and is characterized by increased rates of cardiovascular and limb complications. Management of CLI is rapidly evolving, with the advent of minimally invasive techniques to restore blood flow and advances in wound care. However, there is little consensus regarding optimal treatment. The ongoing NIH-funded BEST-CLI is designed to assess the comparative effectiveness of minimally invasive versus full surgical restoration of blood flow in CLI; however, little is known about current nationwide practice patterns, outcomes, quality of life, and health care resource utilization in CLI. Additionally, the BEST-CLI trial will enroll a selected patient population that may not be fully representative of ""real world"" CLI patients. As a result, in conjunction with the BEST-CLI investigators and BEST-CLI trial, we propose the companion BEST-VIVA registry (vCLI) to investigate the following aims: 1) describe the baseline demographics, comorbidities, and treatment strategies of consecutive patients excluded from the BEST-CLI trial and included in the vCLI registry, with a focus on variations in care; 2) describe the clinical outcomes--specifically major adverse limb events (MALE)-free survival, wound healing, and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE)--by treatment strategy in CLI patients, with a focus on causes of outcome variation within treatment strategy; and 3) describe health care-related quality of life and health care costs, by treatment strategy in the vCLI registry, with a focus on causes of variation in quality of life and costs. Methods: The vCLI registry will be funded by a unique public/private partnership with governance from both vCLI primary investigators and BEST-CLI primary investigators. For aim 1, multilevel multivariate regression will be used to identify patient, physician/hospital, and geographic factors associated with variations in treatment strategies. For aim 2, Kaplan Meier and cumulative incidence estimates of limb and cardiovascular outcomes will be stratified by treatment strategy and other subgroups of interest. The impact of diabetes and chronic kidney disease (CKD) will be quantified by multivariable modeling and clinical risk prediction scores will be developed separately for each treatment strategy. For aim 3, quality of life, costs, and cost-effectiveness will be described for each treatment strategy and sources of variation within each treatment strategy will be identified via multivariable regression. Impact: The results of the grant will help to illuminate current practices and outcomes in the care of CLI. Data generated regarding patient demographics, variations in clinical outcomes, and variations in costs/cost-effectiveness will serve to 1) identify targets for future health care systems interventions to improve adherence to guideline-recommended care, 2) provide context and generalizability for the findings of the BEST-CLI trial, and 3) identify specific health care system targets to help speed the adoption of BEST-CLI Trial findings into clinical practice.",1,1,,,,,,,factors related to critical limb ischemia,0
20201428,Glucose levels and preventable hospitalizations in Alzheimer and diabetes,"As people in the U.S. live longer, persons with comorbid Alzheimer disease or related dementias (hereafter dementia) and diabetes become increasingly common in clinical care. Diabetes is a largely ambulatory and self-managed condition that should not require inpatient care. Persons living with dementia and diabetes (PWD&D), however, have high risks of hospitalizations. These hospitalizations are considered preventable and potentially avoidable. There is a need to understand care considerations in PWD&D that predispose them to potentially preventable hospitalizations (PPH), and this has been articulated as an important national goal. In diabetes, glycemic control has been fundamental in clinical care as it reduces risks of diabetes complications. Older adults with diabetes, in particular those with cognitive deficits, however, may have difficulty managing glucose at home and therefore have higher rates of diabetes complications. PWD&D are also susceptible to overtreatment and have increased health care utilization because of hypoglycemia. Therefore, both the risks of diabetes complications and the risks of therapy (e.g., hypoglycemia) should be considered when setting therapeutic goals. However, the most appropriate glycemic targets for these patients have not been empirically determined. The American Geriatric Society (AGS) and American Diabetes Association (ADA) have promulgated recommendations on optimal glucose targets in persons with cognitive impairment, but these are consensus statements and should be strengthened through higher levels of evidence. To our knowledge, no prior prospective study with research standards for dementia diagnosis has evaluated the implications of incident dementia for glucose control among people with diabetes and, particularly in terms of rates of hospitalizations, PPH, and diabetes-related PPH. We propose to examine the relationship between dementia onset, glucose levels, and rates of different types of hospitalizations in people with diabetes from the National Institute on Aging (NIA)-funded Adult Changes in Thought (ACT) study. ACT resources include extensive clinical laboratory data, incident research-quality dementia diagnoses, and complete capture of hospitalization and medication data. Our first aim will be to determine the extent to which dementia onset is associated with higher rates of overall hospitalizations, rates of PPH, and rates of diabetes-related PPH among persons with treated diabetes. Our second aim will be to evaluate the association of average time-varying individual-level glucose levels with the rates of overall hospitalization, PPH, and diabetes-related PPH while accounting for incident dementia and other time-varying confounders. By leveraging ACT, the proposed study provides an extraordinary opportunity for new observational insights into the associations among dementia, glucose control, and hospitalizations in older persons with diabetes. Findings from this study address national priority and will advance our understanding of the role of glycemic control on admission risks in an understudied aged population and will provide preliminary data for developing strategies that mitigate the adverse effects of over or undertreatment in diabetes management.",1,1,,,,,,,dementia and gluocse levels,0
20202196,"Effect of ACA Medicaid expansion on diabetes: diagnosis, treatment, patient compliance, and health outcomes","Diabetes and its complications are among the largest contributors to health care costs, cost growth, and patient morbidity and mortality. Diabetes is often not timely diagnosed. When it is diagnosed, patients often fail to comply with a complex treatment regimen. The health burden of diabetes falls disproportionately on the poor and on ethnic minorities. A central goal of our project is to examine how the Affordable Care Act (ACA) expansion of Medicaid will affect diabetes diagnosis, treatment, and outcomes among the newly enrolled. We will do so using the natural experiment that results from some states expanding Medicaid and others choosing not to do so, combined with detailed, longitudinal electronic health records (EHR) for a large population of 9 million persons in four expansion and five non-expansion states. The combination of a multistate shock to Medicaid eligibility and large-scale access to EHR is unique. Prior studies of adult Medicaid expansions have been small scale, have been short duration, have lacked detailed health records, or have been a combination of these limitations. The best available study, the Oregon Health Insurance Experiment, compared 6,000 new Medicaid recipients to 6,000 controls in a single state, for a two-year period. The Oregon research found large increases in diabetes diagnosis and use of diabetes medication, but no significant change in blood sugar levels. Yet any effect of Medicaid on outcomes will emerge slowly. In contrast, we estimate that we will have 100-150,000 new Medicaid recipients, 5 years of pretreatment data to establish baseline health and match treated individuals to controls, 6 years of posttreatment data in the study period (with potential follow-up after that), and several treated states, with different Medicaid programs, and potential to expand to additional states. This will let us study both near- and medium-term outcomes and assess whether treatment effects vary with personal characteristics or the nature of the Medicaid program. A second project goal is to innovate in causal inference methods. We will combine difference-in-differences (DiD), matching, and multiple imputation methods. We will use matching and multiple imputation methods to match control persons in non-expansion states to match to new Medicaid enrollees in expansion states. We will use distributed lag regressions to map the emergence of any treatment effect over time. DiD, matching, and multiple imputation methods have not to our knowledge been combined in a single study. This combined design will be useful in studying other health insurance expansions.",1,,,,,1,,,ACA evaluation,0
20202197,Impact of health savings account (HSA) cost sharing reductions on high-deductible members with diabetes,"High-deductible health plans (HDHPs) have lower premiums but require patients to pay the full cost of most medical care until annual deductibles of $1000 to $6000 are met. HDHPs have proliferated rapidly over the last decade. Health savings account (HSA)-qualified HDHPs are the most rapidly growing HDHP arrangement, now covering 14% of commercially insured Americans. These plans subject most health care services (including medications) to high annual deductibles but allow pre-tax contributions to accounts that can be used for medical costs. Advocates believe that exposing patients to greater costs will create ""activated consumers"" who will seek higher value health care and adopt healthy behaviors, while critics fear that these economic barriers may reduce access to needed care. Our ongoing project in the Natural Experiments in Diabetes Translation (NEXT-D) initiative (5U58DP002719) has determined that diabetes patients with HSA-HDHPs experience the largest reductions in hospital access and adherence to key medications for chronic illness. Although these findings are concerning, federal regulations allow employers to tailor HSA-HDHPs through two mechanisms that could improve access to care: (1) exempting certain chronic medications from deductible requirements (i.e., medications cost $0 to patients) through ""preventive drug lists"" ($0-PDs); and (2) generously funding HSAs so that employees pay less out of pocket. Thus, HSA-HDHPs represent both a risk to diabetes patients but also an opportunity for employers to improve care through tailored cost sharing reductions. In this application, we will examine effects of these two important variations in HDHP design on diabetes secondary prevention, high-priority care, diabetes complications, and costs, both overall and among vulnerable subgroups (men, low socioeconomic status, black or Hispanic, severe diabetes, high comorbidity). We will employ a cutting-edge interrupted time series study design that approximates the estimates of randomized controlled trials. We will draw from a 12-year rolling cohort (2005-2017) of >60 million members insured by a large national health plan, with 30,000 diabetes patients who experience employer-mandated transitions to HSA-HDHPs. We will also conduct economic analyses from the employer and member perspectives of the impacts of $0-PDs and generously funded HSAs on total health care and out-of-pocket costs. Our findings will allow policy makers and employers to develop tailored, next-generation health insurance designs that optimize quality and equity for diabetes patients who are most vulnerable under HDHPs.",1,,,,,1,,,high deductible health plans,0
20193103,Using peer navigators to increase access to VA and community resources for veterans with diabetes-related distress,"Diabetes-related distress, the negative emotional impact of living with diabetes (DM), is a powerful predictor of psychosocial functioning, treatment adherence, and glycemic control. Practice guidelines and consensus statements call for innovative approaches to address DM-related distress. Despite availability of self-management and psychosocial interventions to reduce DM-related distress, these interventions are underutilized due to constraints in time, finances, motivation, and resource awareness. Interventions that leverage traditional medical care and community-based health promotion programs (e.g., DM self-management education [DSME] programs) may enhance the ability of veterans with DM to engage with a broad and accessible range of resources. Ensuring that veterans with DM receive adequate self-care support requires interventions that (1) attend to both medical care and diabetes-related distress and (2) improve veterans' access and engagement with DSME and traditional medical/mental care. Integrating Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and community health services and DSME resources is innovative and affords great opportunities to enhance veteran outcomes and build VA community partnerships. Engagement of veterans and community organizations in developing and delivering care responds to the 2016 Health Services Research and Development Service (HSR&D) high-priority domain of Health Care Systems Change and aligns with the 2017 VA Under Secretary's priorities of greater choice (offering community and VA resources), efficiency (community and VA coordination), and timeliness (telephone delivery). This community-VA partnership and three-month veteran peer coaching intervention (iNSPiRED) aims to enhance psychological wellbeing and diabetes self-management behavior in veterans with DM by facilitating access to and use of health care and health promotion resources. The intervention focuses on reducing cognitive and practical barriers to use of services by engaging veteran peers as coaches and navigators, and by encouraging engagement in health promotion and health care services in the VA and the greater community. A secondary goal, integral to the main goal, is to strengthen and integrate Veterans Health Administration (VHA) partnerships with community-based organizations and veteran support organizations (VSOs). This is a single-blind, parallel group randomized trial of a 3-month peer navigation intervention for veterans with DM and elevated levels of DM-related distress. We will recruit veterans with DM-related distress through existing help seeking channels within and outside of the VA in partnership with community agencies, veteran service organizations (VSOs), and the Houston VA Medical Center (VAMC). Eligible veterans will be assigned at random to the iNSPiRED intervention (peer navigation and coaching) versus usual care (written resource materials and encouragement to continue follow-up with health care providers). Consistent with the focus on the overall emotional impact of DM, the primary outcome is DM-related distress (DM Distress Scale [DDS]). In previous studies the DDS has shown strong relationships with psychological symptoms, self-management behaviors, and objective measures of glycemic control. Secondary outcomes include anxiety symptoms (Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale), depression symptoms (Patient Health Questionnaire-8), DM self-management behaviors (DM Self-Management Scale), and self-reported use and new use of VA or community resources. In addition to participant-level outcomes, we will also assess stakeholder outcomes through a mixed-methods process evaluation. Our objective will be to measure the impact of stakeholder engagement activities on development and sustainability of VA-community partnerships, trust and communication, and capacity building. Assessment of primary and secondary endpoints will occur at baseline, post-intervention, and at 6 months. If this project meets intended goals, we will partner with VHA Office of Community Engagement and VHA Specialty Care to implement the intervention for DM and other chronic diseases.",1,,1,,1,,,,peer navigation and community organizations,1
20193153,A direct-to-patient alert for glycated hemoglobin screening using prediction modeling and mobile health (mHealth),"The purpose of this project is to develop a novel direct-to-patient alert using text messaging. The text messages will be targeted to patients found to be at a high risk for elevated blood sugar using a previously validated risk calculator that was created from routine data available in an electronic health record (EHR), which was found to be significantly more accurate than existing tools for identifying at-risk patients. Text messages will be sent to high-risk individuals who have agreed to receive texts. The message will inform patients of their elevated risk for diabetes, invite patients to undergo a free diabetes screening test, and provide a link to a web page containing additional relevant information. Studies that improve the detection of patients with abnormal glucose are important because most patients diagnosed with type 2 diabetes already have evidence of end-organ damage by the time the disease is identified. Earlier diagnosis can lead to additional prevention strategies to detect and reduce associated morbidities by alerting the physician and patient to a previously unrecognized health status and facilitate shared decision making. The patients will be offered the opportunity to undergo a free diabetes screening test (glycated hemoglobin) that does not require fasting, can be performed at the patients' convenience, and does not require an office visit. Patients with an elevated glycated hemoglobin (>5.7%) will be encouraged to follow up with their physician. An additional component of the grant is a qualitative study that will perform focus groups with patients to create the most appealing texting intervention possible. Preliminary findings indicate a strong preference for texting over alternative modes of communication and identify favorable content components and phrasing. The inclusion of an informational web page was suggested by preliminary focus groups to enhance content and length of the message. The qualitative component is important as it explores ways to optimize direct patient engagement as a means to overcome the poor response of physicians to electronic reminders due to a phenomenon that has been termed, ""alert fatigue."" The project is also novel in the use of text messaging, which has recently become both inexpensive and widely available across all ages, races, and income groups for a direct-to-patient intervention. Previous research indicates that universal screening for diabetes is not cost-effective, while targeted screening using crude patient groups is marginally cost-effective. Although this pilot grant will likely be too small to demonstrate definitive cost benefits of targeted diabetes screening using a risk calculator, it will set the stage for a larger randomized trial in the future. This pilot and a future trial can also contribute to the wider assessment of the viability of texting as a tool for preventive medicine in general and serve as evidence to support greater routine use of interventions involving accessible and cost-effective health information technology methods that are currently underutilized by demonstrating successful flow from application of the calculator to EHR data to text to laboratory results. The authors strongly believe in patient empowerment and hope that this project will encourage more studies to leverage direct patient interventions based on personalized recommendations to promote self-efficacy and equity within the healthcare system.",1,1,,,,,,,text messaging,1
20193248,Enhanced enrollment in the National Diabetes Prevention Program for the underserved: a randomized control trial,"Type 2 diabetes affects 9.4% of US adults with higher rates among racial/ethnic minorities and individuals of low socioeconomic status. The National Diabetes Prevention Program (NDPP) is an evidence-based and widely disseminated behavioral intervention to reduce diabetes incidence through modest weight loss. However, retention in the year-long NDPP is problematic and leads to suboptimal weight loss, especially among Hispanic, non-Hispanic black, and low-income non-Hispanic white participants. Strategies to improve NDPP engagement and weight loss are needed urgently, especially for these subgroups. Pilot results of the Pre-NDPP, a novel enhancement to enrollment in the NDPP based on the health belief model, were highly successful in a non-randomized cohort study among 1,140 racially diverse, predominately low-income participants. Outcomes of 75 Pre-NDPP participants who enrolled in the NDPP were compared to 1,065 prior participants using ANCOVA (analysis of covariance) and multivariable logistic regression. Pre-session participants stayed in the NDPP 99.8 days longer (p<.001) and attended 14.3% more sessions (p<.001) on average than those without a pre-session. Pre-session participants lost 2.0% more weight (p<.001) and were 3.5 times more likely to achieve the 5% weight loss target (p<.001). Sensitivity analyses were consistent. Findings suggest pre-sessions may be a promising and pragmatic strategy to improve NDPP effectiveness and mitigate disparities in program outcomes, but a randomized controlled trial (RCT) is needed to determine whether Pre-NDPP reliably improves NDPP outcomes. The purpose of this study is to 1) conduct an RCT comparing NDPP attendance and weight loss outcomes between participants who receive Pre-NDPP vs. direct enrollment into the NDPP (usual care); 2) examine potential effect mediators (perceived risk for developing diabetes and self-efficacy and readiness for weight control) and moderators (race/ethnicity and income level); and 3) evaluate implementation factors, including cost and projected return on investment. The long-term goal is to disseminate a scalable, evidence-based strategy to improve success of the NDPP and reduce disparities in NDPP effectiveness. If found to be effective, Pre-NDPP can be disseminated to all NDPP providers, including more than 1,700 NDPP sites, and may be supported by current NDPP payers such as Medicare, commercial insurers, and employer groups. Thus, this approach has a high potential to impact the burden of type 2 diabetes and related health disparities across the country.",1,1,,,,,,,pre-sessions for DPP,1
20192217,Social networks in medical homes and impact on patient care and outcomes,"The patient-centered medical home (PCMH) model aims to address primary care challenges, such as poor access and quality and rising costs, by delivering team-based care, particularly for chronic diseases. Yet little is known about the composition of effective teams to achieve best patient outcomes. Furthermore, how team members communicate, share advice, or help to deliver care or how the resulting social structures (i.e., social networks) affect quality and outcomes has not been studied. Our innovative mixed-methods study will fill this gap. We will combine analysis of team configurations and social networks in PCMH practices with assessment of quality of care and patient outcomes to identify team best practices. We will also collect qualitative data to assess the underlying teamwork dynamics not captured quantitatively. The specific aims are to 1) identify factors determining team configurations and the formation of social networks in primary care practices adopting the PCMH model; 2) investigate how team configurations and social networks impact quality of care and patient outcomes for five chronic conditions; and 3) identify barriers, facilitators, and characteristics of teamwork for teams with different configurations, social networks, and performance. Practices (n=24) with the PCMH model at New York-Presbyterian Hospital/Columbia University and Weill Cornell Medical Centers and the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center will participate. We will recruit team members, including clinicians and staff (n=1,437), through online surveys who will identify their team members from the clinic's roster and report with whom they communicate, share advice and/or support, and trust or approach to solve problems. We expect an 80% response rate (n=1,150). We will obtain patient data on quality of care and outcomes for diabetes, asthma, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and merge it with survey data. *ORA and R software will be used for data analysis. We will map team configuration and social networks, visualize them, and compute network metrics. We will then build exponential random graph models to predict factors explaining the observed networks and multilevel models to assess the impact of network variables on quality of care and patient outcomes. Based on aim 1 findings, we will recruit participants who are highly (n=~20) and poorly (n=~20) connected to their team members in social networks. Based on aim 2 findings, we will recruit participants from high- (n=~20) and low- (n=~20) performing teams. We will conduct individual face-to-face interviews with them using an interview guide. Interviews will be audiotaped and transcribed, and data will undergo content analysis. Multiple researchers will code the data and identify themes. Quantitative and qualitative findings will be triangulated. This study has the potential to show how to facilitate teamwork and identify the most effective team attributes to assure best quality of care and outcomes, particularly for patients with chronic diseases (Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality's [AHRQ] priority population). This application is in response to the Special Emphasis Notice (SEN) NOT-HS-16-011 on AHRQ's interest in applications related to innovative primary care research.",1,,1,,,,,,how team members communicate,1
20192190,Patient- and caregiver-centered diabetes telemanagement program for Hispanic/Latino patients,"Over half of Hispanics/Latinos will develop type 2 diabetes in their lifetime. This increases the risk of death and other health issues such as amputation by 50-100% more than for non-Hispanic white patients with type 2 diabetes. Diabetes telemanagement programs (DTM) can now use technology to connect patients with their care provider for a weekly ""tele-visit"" and allow them to have their blood sugar and vital signs monitored daily. The purpose of this study is to see whether providing this kind of programming will improve care for patients with type 2 diabetes, compared to comprehensive outpatient management, the most common treatment approach for Hispanic patients from lower income and health access communities. There are two parts to this study. The first part uses qualitative methods to ""adapt"" the DTM program intervention for Hispanic/Latino disparity patients, using a community advisory board comprised of patients, caregivers, community leaders, and other important stakeholders such as community-based organizations (Vida Si, Diabetes No) and the American Diabetes Association. The second part tests this ""adapted"" program scientifically using what is called a randomized controlled trial, to see if it is more effective than comprehensive outpatient management. Patients who receive comprehensive outpatient management receive clinic care to manage their type 2 diabetes, while the patients who receive DTM (and their caregivers--such as their children) will be given tablets (like an iPad) that easily connects them to the nurse practitioner. The caregiver part of the program was suggested by our community advisory board, as well as by interviews with patients. The idea is that patients who are more engaged in their care through DTM will experience less illness, less hospitalization, have a better quality of life, and be more self-confident in their ability to manage their diabetes. We also want to see if involving caregivers improves the care and quality of life of patients. While this kind of intervention has been studied in the general population, and has found that sugar management improves, no one has studied whether this will be better for Hispanic disparity patients with type 2 diabetes--so this will be the first study of its kind. This study is an important one, because our patients tell us (and other studies have shown) that the outcomes we are focusing on are important to them. We are looking at quality of life, confidence in managing diabetes, hospitalizations, use of emergency department services, and worry (""distress"") about their diabetes.

20192344,The impact of state-mandated insurance benefits and reimbursement provisions on access to diabetes self-management education and training (DSME/T),"With an estimated 30.2 million diagnosed and undiagnosed cases among adults (and another 84 million at risk), diabetes mellitus is one of the most prevalent chronic conditions and a leading cause of mortality in the US. Diabetes self-management education and training (DSME/T) is a recognized standard of care and provides patients with the requisite knowledge and skills to properly manage the condition, improve long-term health outcomes, and reduce health care spending. Yet, only (58%) of adults with diabetes report ever receiving formal DSME/T. Health insurance coverage that does not include benefits for DSME/T effectively imposes barriers to access for patients with limited financial resources. Many states have adopted legislation that requires public and/or private insurers to provide benefits for DSME/T; however, these requirements vary by state. It is unclear if these policies effectively improve access to DSME/T services. The objective of this proposal is to rigorously assess the impact of state-mandated health insurance benefits and reimbursement provisions on access to DSME/T among vulnerable, low-income patients with diabetes. Aim 1, quantify the change in the supply of DSME/T programs and certified providers (potential access) before and after the adoption of state-mandated benefits, tests the hypothesis that enactment of DSME/T insurance requirements is associated with an increase in the number of accredited DSME/T programs and certified providers within a state. This aim merges two novel datasets to provide a census of accredited DSME/T programs and certified providers and detail provisions of state benefit mandates over a period of ten years for 30 US states. Aim 2, quantify the impact of state-mandated insurance benefits on utilization (realized access) of DSME/T, tests the hypothesis that Medicaid insurance requirements increases utilization of DSME/T among Medicaid patients with diabetes. This aim will utilize a 9-year panel from twenty states included in the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) from 2008 to 2016. Aim 3, examine the association between patients' evaluated need for DSME/T and providers' referral orders for DSME/T (equitable access), will utilize electronic health record data (2010-2017) from a safety net population to test the hypothesis that patients' ""evaluated need"" will increase the likelihood of receiving a DSME/T referral during a provider encounter. The proposed study is significant because it rigorously measures the impact of decades of state policies to address a ""priority condition"" in the US. This study is innovative because it extends the evidence base for diabetes care services through the use of novel data sources and a more sophisticated and policy-relevant measurement approach. Lastly, the proposed study effectively targets a high-priority research area as defined by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ): increasing the accessibility of health care.",1,,,,,1,,,state mandated benefits,1
20192336,Impact of VA disability and health benefits on long-term diabetes outcomes among Vietnam-era veterans,"Anticipated impacts on veterans' health: This study will determine the extent to which disability compensation and more generous Veterans Affairs (VA) health benefits among Vietnam-era veterans improved short- and long-term outcomes of diabetes. This contribution is significant because one-quarter of VA enrollees have diabetes, and the complications related to diabetes account for substantial morbidity and spending among veterans. Prior research suggests that intermediate and long-range outcomes in diabetes may be related to social determinants of health. We evaluate the health effects of a VA policy that directly intervenes on a key social determinant (income) among veterans with diabetes. Project background: In July 2001, the VA expanded the medical eligibility criteria for Vietnam-era veterans to include diabetes as a service-connected condition. The change in policy was motivated by an Institute of Medicine (IOM) study of the association of Agent Orange, an herbicide used by the U.S. government during the Vietnam War, with the onset of type 2 diabetes. Specifically, any veterans who had ""boots on the ground"" (BOG) in Vietnam, Cambodia, or Laos during the 1964 to 1975 period was deemed to be exposed to Agent Orange and therefore eligible for disability compensation and more generous health benefits, including zero medication copayments. The approximately 55% of Vietnam-era veterans who did not have BOG during the war (Not on Ground [NOG]) were ineligible for disability compensation due to diabetes. Prior work by members of our research team found that the 2001 policy change led to a 30% relative increase in income for veterans with BOG relative to their NOG counterparts. The value of these benefits is further enhanced because they are not subject to federal taxes and are made in perpetuity irrespective of other employment income. Project objective: The overall objective of this application is to examine the impact of a major change in VA policy that led to increased disability compensation and health benefits for some, but not all, Vietnam-era veterans with diabetes. We have the following specific aims: (aim 1) examine whether increased benefits to Vietnam-era veterans with diabetes resulted in better control of glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and blood pressure, and increased adherence to medications; (aim 2) examine whether increased disability and health benefits to Vietnam-era veterans with diabetes reduced micro and macrovascular complications of diabetes; and (aim 3) examine whether more generous benefits to Vietnam-era veterans with diabetes lowered mortality. Project methods: Using a quasi-experimental study design that includes 15 years of follow-up data (2001-2016), we will examine the effects of increased annual income as well as more generous health coverage on a comprehensive set of short- and long-term outcomes of diabetes. Data on our main treatment variable, BOG status, will come from the Office of Economic Manpower Analysis (OEMA) of the U.S. Army. This data will be merged at the individual level with data on all Vietnam-era army veterans who are enrolled in the VA health care system as of July 2001. This data will provide us with detailed outcomes on medication adherence, glycosylated hemoglobin, blood pressure, diabetic complications, and mortality. Our study population will focus on veterans with a diagnosis of diabetes prior to July 2001 to avoid the potential bias that eligible veterans who had BOG may have been motivated to be diagnosed with diabetes after the policy change. In our primary study design, we propose to compare the change in the time trend in the BOG-NOG difference in outcomes before and after the policy change (2001 and prior years vs. 2002 and later years).",1,,,1,,,,,evaluate different levels of mandated disability comp,1
20191030,Epidemiology and clinical outcomes of diabetic macular edema,"Approximately 25% of the millions of veterans (est. 8.92 million FY 2013) enrolled for care in Veterans Health Administration (VHA) have diabetes mellitus, and diabetic macular edema (DME) is the leading cause of vision loss in the adult diabetic population worldwide. Although diabetic retinopathy (DR) has been well studied, comparatively little is known about the burden of DME. In fact, only two national prevalence studies and no national study on the incidence of DME in persons with type 2 diabetes have been conducted. Similarly, many risk factors have been characterized for DR, but no large studies have established predictors for DME. Beyond the Medicare claims database, the VHA National Patient Care Database (NPCD) contains standardized administrative data for several aspects of patient care including diagnoses, procedures, medications, lab test results, vital signs, clinical text notes, and mortality. Because the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) uses teleretinal screening as routine clinical care for all patients with diabetes with these results included in the NPCD, the NPCD is an ideal source for studying the epidemiology of and risk factors for DME. This study proposes to determine the burden of diabetic macular edema, establish risk factors, and examine treatment outcomes in a previously extracted dataset on 1.98 million veterans who have undergone diabetic retinopathy screening at least once since 2004. Currently invaluable ophthalmic data are encoded in unstructured clinical encounter notes in the Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS), and no validated automated extraction method exists to capture these data elements. An automated extraction method using natural language processing will be created and validated to unlock key ophthalmic variables. These text extraction methods will be applicable to extracting ophthalmology data from not only notes of patients with DME but also any ophthalmology clinical note. This will enable future large-scale studies in ophthalmology using NPCD and be immediately valuable to the research community at large. The candidate, Dr. Aaron Lee, MD, MSCI, is an ophthalmologist with subspecialty training in retina surgery with a strong background in computer science and epidemiology. His career goal is to become an independent clinician scientist studying diabetic eye disease with large-scale electronic medical record extracted data. While he possesses the foundational skills, he seeks to gain training in advanced statistics and natural language processing to unlock the data captured in unstructured clinical encounter notes. He has assembled an outstanding mentorship team under the primary mentor, Dr. Edward Boyko, MD, MPH. This mentorship team includes renowned experts in clinical epidemiology, health informatics, ophthalmology, and natural language processing. This K23 will provide Dr. Lee the structured coursework, mentorship, and applied learning needed to acquire new research skills. He will leverage key local resources to carry out the proposed research at the University of Washington and the VA Seattle Epidemiologic Research and Information Center.",1,,,,,,1,,natural language processing. ,1
20191115,Resource curation and evaluation for EHR note comprehension,"The American Diabetes Association estimates that over 25.8 million Americans have diabetes. Proper patient self-management is perhaps the most critical and under-exercised element for patients to achieve appropriate glycemic control and thus mitigate complications and comorbid conditions, and implement appropriate preventive strategies (e.g., vaccines, exercise, healthy diet). In previous work we have shown that educating patients by using content in their medical records improved diabetes outcomes and that NoteAid, a multi-module natural language processing system that links medical jargon in electronic health records to definitions, has improved self-reported comprehension. Here we propose to develop NoteAid with a high-quality resource of expert-curated lay definitions and evaluation methods for diabetes patients' note comprehension.",1,1,,,,,,,"NoteAid, NLP-esque",1
20191168,"Creating community driven, personalized health maps for patients with diabetes","This National Library of Medicine (NLM) R01 proposal aims to develop and test a personal health library platform for patients with diabetes and prediabetes, harnessing both personal health and health care data (e.g., medication lists, upcoming appointments, self-tracking of diet and blood sugars) and location-based mapped data about neighborhood health resources (e.g., community reviews about the quality of grocery stores and parks). Diabetes and prediabetes patients have substantial needs for tracking and accessing health and health care information that are poorly met by existing platforms that largely operate in silos. Furthermore, existing digital health tools have not utilized participatory design approaches and have low uptake among specific subgroups, such as racial/ethnic minority and lower income populations. In this project, we will use design science to create and evaluate a new personal health library platform to strengthen and improve the ways in which low-income individuals and communities of color access and interact with personal health data that better reflect their needs and interests. Specifically, we propose to create a new platform that enables patients with diabetes or prediabetes to import their personal health data to a mapping platform, in order to have access to store and view both private and public views of health promoting and health inhibiting community factors in their own neighborhood. This new platform will be titled Mapping to Amplify the Vitality of Engaged Neighborhoods, or MAVEN. In aim 1, we will use inductive observational methods to follow community leaders/health advocates and patients with either diabetes or prediabetes to understand existing health and health care journeys and map existing resources in their neighborhoods. We will recruit patients and community-based organization leaders from 3 San Francisco neighborhoods with the highest prevalence of diabetes and pre-diabetes, which also correspond with existing San Francisco Health Network clinics in our health care system. In aim 2, we will recruit a second sample of individuals to complete user-centered design methods (e.g., card-sorting and think-a-loud interviews) to prioritize and test prototypes of data elements within the new MAVEN personal health library platform. In aim 3, we will conduct real-world usability testing of a functional version of the MAVEN platform to explore its acceptability and usability in everyday life. Because we will engage racially/ethnically and socioeconomically diverse patients in this project, we will ensure that the MAVEN personal health library platform is relevant for patients with varying levels of health literacy and technology proficiency. In addition, because we will engage community health advocates and public health care system leaders, our findings will have more direct implications for implementation and dissemination.",1,1,,,1,,,,individual and community factors for personal health library,1
20191180,Automatic generation of computer interpretable guidelines,"Compliance with clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) has been demonstrated to markedly improve patient care, but the tools and processes available for physicians to rapidly and meaningfully leverage these guidelines are currently sub-optimal. Compliance improves greatly with the introduction of clinical decision support systems (CDSS), which implement guideline recommendations and are integrated into electronic health record (EHR) systems. Unfortunately, CPGs, as commonly distributed, contain recommendations for care of only a single disorder (or class of disorders) and are not easily consumable by computers for integration with CDSS. Recent work has focused on methods to resolve conflicts between guidelines, but only once they are in a computer interpretable form--a computer interpretable guideline (CIG). We aim (1) to develop a system for computational understanding of CPGs from the unstructured text, (2) to ground the clinical terms in each guideline in its definition so that the produced CIG can better integrate with electronic health record systems, and (3) to generate CIGs in a format already developed that allows guidelines to be mediated with each other and allows the creation of CDSS. The project will focus on four clinical guidelines, relating to diabetes, heart disease, non-small cell lung, and prostate cancers. Samples of each of the guidelines will be annotated by clinicians with the appropriate output of systems accomplishing each of the three aims. These samples will be split into datasets for testing and for evaluation, with the overall goal to achieve human levels of competence for each aim.",1,,,,,,1,,computer interoperability guidelines,1
20191299,Advancing patient safety for antipsychotic-treated children: examining state implementation of safe use practices,"This project will address, at scale, improvement of safe use practices for antipsychotic (AP) treatment of Medicaid children. Safe and judicious management of APs poses significant challenges, given hazards that include elevated risk of type 2 diabetes, weight gain, hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia, and potential long-term impact on brain development. Safety evidence and guidelines highlight the importance of several key safe use practices that can help mitigate these risks, including monitoring blood glucose and lipids, avoiding concurrent use of multiple different APs, first-line use of non-pharmacological mental health services, and minimizing use among pre-school children. Prior AHRQ-supported projects have led to Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set/Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (HEDIS/CMS) quality metrics for these practices, but their implementation is highly inconsistent. Many state initiatives have been implemented to improve these safe use practices, but the impact of alternative strategies for increasing safe use is unknown. Evidence on their effects is critically needed. We will use a mixed-methods strategy to identify and document state implementation of safe use initiatives; assess their impact on safe use metrics; investigate causal mechanisms underlying effectiveness; and actively disseminate results to state decision makers, health plans, clinical communities, and other stakeholders. This process will support translation, implementation, and improvement of effective strategies across states. We will provide a comprehensive analysis of systems-level strategies, using a national survey and case studies in 8 purposively sampled states, to investigate distinctive approaches. We will use key informant interviews and systematic document review to identify implementation timelines, strategies, causal mechanisms, barriers and solutions, and tools utilized. We will then use Medicaid claims data to assess change in the use of the targeted practices following the implementation of state systems-level strategies, using difference-in-difference, triple-difference, and other modeling strategies. States that did not implement similar initiatives will serve as comparators. Finally, we will actively disseminate an evidence-informed toolkit to state and stakeholder communities, utilizing active dissemination strategies successfully employed in prior AHRQ-supported partnerships. This toolkit will be developed to facilitate a self-assessment and prioritization of improvement initiatives, identification of other state strategies, and provide quality improvement and evaluation tools to assess effectiveness over time. Evidence development and active dissemination will assure that evidence on effective system improvement processes is available, understood, and effectively used to improve patient safety across populations of vulnerable children served by state Medicaid/Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) systems and reduce AP-related harms.",1,1,,,,,,,antipsychotic treatment w t1d,1
20191349,i-Matter: investigating an mHealth texting tool for embedding patient-reported data into diabetes management,"Uncontrolled type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a major health problem in the US that constitutes a significant cause of morbidity and mortality, particularly in vulnerable populations who continue to suffer disproportionately higher rates of complications. Despite the significant physical and psychosocial impact T2D has on patients' behavioral, functional, and clinical outcomes, much of clinical practice continues to neglect patients' perspective of their T2D giving preference to the physiological aspects of the disease. However, without incorporation of patients' perspective of their health and functional status into diabetes care, achievement of the outcomes desired by patients and primary care providers (PCP) will be unattainable. To address this gap, we will use the technology acceptance model and capability-opportunity-motivation model of behavior to evaluate the efficacy of a technology-based patient-reported outcome (PRO) system, the Modern Journal System (MJS), for management of T2D (MJS DIABETES). MJS is an innovative mobile platform that utilizes text messaging to capture PRO data in real time, enhances patient engagement through data-driven feedback and motivational messages, and creates dynamic data visualizations of the PRO data that can be shared through printed reports and integrated into the electronic health record (EHR). Using a mixed-methods design, we will conduct this study in two phases: 1) a formative phase, using the evidence-based, user-centered design approach; and 2) a clinical efficacy phase. The formative phase will use qualitative methods to a) adapt MJS DIABETES to the needs of PCP and patients with T2D; b) integrate MJS DIABETES into the EHR system, primary care practice, as well as the lives of patients with T2D; and c) evaluate the usability of MJS DIABETES in a subset of T2D patients and PCPs in order to optimize the tool's performance and workflow integration. For the clinical efficacy phase, we will evaluate in a randomized control trial, the efficacy of MJS DIABETES versus usual care (UC) on reduction in HbA1c at 12 months, among 282 patients with T2D who receive care in safety net practices. Patients randomized to the intervention arm will be enrolled in MJS DIABETES where they will receive and respond to PROs via text message, receive data-driven feedback and motivational messages based on patterns of their PROs, and receive journal reports over the 12-month study. PCPs will have access to reports of patients' PRO data through the MJS-EHR interface, which can be viewed during visits with the patient or asynchronously to track patient PROs between visits. Patients randomized to the UC arm will receive standard T2D treatment recommendations, as determined by their PCP. The primary outcome will be mean reduction in HbA1c from baseline to 12 months. Secondary outcomes will include changes in a) patient adherence to self-care behaviors (e.g., lifestyle and medication recommendations); and b) theoretical mediators of diabetes knowledge, self-efficacy, outcomes expectations, and patient-provider communication. Regardless of group assignment, all outcome data will be assessed at baseline, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months.",1,1,,,,,,,text messaging and PRO data within diabetes,1
20191453,Prevent Diabetes Mellitus (PreDM) Clinical Decision Support intervention in community health centers,"Eighty-six million U.S. adults have prediabetes, and up to 75% of them will eventually develop diabetes. Landmark clinical trials have established that intensive lifestyle interventions (ILI) and metformin are safe and effective treatments to prevent or delay diabetes in adults with prediabetes and overweight/obesity. Despite being included in expert clinical guidelines, these treatments are rarely used, and few studies have explored how to promote their uptake in practice. One possible approach for increasing adoption of ILI and metformin in primary care includes clinical decision support (CDS), which uses electronic systems to create tailored recommendations for evidence-based clinical care. While a large body of evidence demonstrates that CDS can improve the delivery of other recommended preventive services, this approach has not been definitively studied for ILI and metformin. We plan to address this critical knowledge gap by developing and evaluating the Prevent Diabetes Mellitus Clinical Decision Support (PreDM CDS) intervention for community health center patients with prediabetes and overweight/obesity. This novel CDS engages primary care providers and clinical staff to deliver the following intervention components: 1) a decision aid about diabetes prevention developed by our team, 2) an electronic health record (EHR) referral to community-based ILI that meet recommended program requirements, and 3) a prompt for providers to consider prescribing metformin. Clinicians will receive monthly feedback about their use of the PreDM CDS through an existing dashboard. By accomplishing the following specific aims, this definitive R18 study will test the potential for CDS to promote diabetes prevention and weight loss efforts in primary care. In aim 1, we will develop the proposed intervention by translating narrative guidelines about ILI and metformin into CDS, while incorporating extensive feedback from users. Aim 2 is a pragmatic cluster randomized trial, including 6 large community health center sites, which will examine the effectiveness of the PreDM CDS at inducing weight loss and improving other cardiometabolic markers. Aim 3 is a mixed-methods evaluation of the PreDM CDS, exploring its reach, adoption, implementation, maintenance, and cost. We hypothesize that the proposed PreDM CDS will increase patients' adoption of ILI and metformin, producing weight loss and improvements in other cardiometabolic markers. The resulting data, and an implementation toolkit created by the study team, will support the widespread dissemination of the PreDM CDS if found to be effective in the proposed study. Our proposal is responsive to PA-17-261 by 1) developing new CDS that incorporates evidence-based guidelines for diabetes prevention that are infrequently used in current clinical practice; 2) evaluating the impact of the proposed CDS on patient outcomes, clinical workflows, health care process measures, adherence to guidelines, and costs; and 3) conducting this R18 study in a health center-controlled network that serves a minority-predominant population and has the capacity to disseminate the proposed PreDM CDS throughout its national network of community health centers serving 2 million patients.",1,1,,1,,,,,intervention on providers to refer to community intervention,1
20191474,Ambulatory pediatric safety learning lab,"After almost two decades of research and quality improvement, hospitalized children in the US are safer from healthcare-related harm. The vast-majority of healthcare, however, is provided in the clinic and at home, and few studies in this context have demonstrated how to improve safety. Children are especially vulnerable to preventable harm caused by healthcare for many reasons, including weight-based medication dosing, handoffs between caregivers, and their limited ability to communicate evolving symptoms. At home, two in five children with chronic disease have a medication error. Of these, 3.6% are injured due to these errors--the same rate as hospitalized children. Among the 165,000 children with type 1 diabetes (T1D) nationally, 20% have poor glycemic control. The leading cause of death before age 30 among individuals with T1D is acute complications (e.g., severe hypoglycemia, diabetic ketoacidosis). One in 68 children have autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Of these children, 40% take antipsychotic medications, and most are not screened for complications. Management of chronic conditions with families is complex and offers a myriad of opportunities for system failures to occur that can lead to patient harm. We have identified 3 key opportunities to reduce the 2 most egregious harms in this setting--medication errors and treatment delays--in 2 different conditions. The Ambulatory Pediatric Patient Safety Learning Lab aims to 1) redesign processes for adjustment of medication dosing based on clinical information gathered by the patient/family to prevent medication errors (This will be studied in type 1 diabetes.); 2) create processes for patient/family medication monitoring and communication with clinic to prevent adverse drug events (This will be studied in children with autism spectrum disorder on antipsychotics.); and 3) design a workflow to plan for, detect, and prompt management of serious illness among children with chronic conditions at home (This will be studied in both populations.). This learning lab integrates design and systems engineering--in collaboration with Mad*Pow, and University of Wisconsin Systems Engineering Initiative for Patient Safety--with Cincinnati Children's expertise in patient-centered research and implementation. The overarching goal is to redesign systems of care and coordination between the clinic and home to eliminate harm due to healthcare in these settings. Problem analysis will include ethnography in the home and clinic, interviews, failure modes and effects analyses (FMEAs), and digital diaries. We will implement all interventions together in the simulated environment and evaluate using a randomized factorial trial. Finally, we will implement in our clinical system with qualitative and quantitative evaluation. The intent is to develop a scalable model which leverages health systems and patient/family strengths to ensure safe healthcare among all children. Upon completion of this proposal, our team is perfectly poised to scale this nationally through the Solutions for Patient Safety (SPS) Network and improve pediatric ambulatory safety across the US.",1,,1,,,,,,"medication errors in at-home treatment, t1d",1
20191538,Utilization management in the Medicare Part D program,"Utilization management policies, which include prior authorization requirements, step therapy protocols, and quantity limits, are becoming increasingly common in Medicare Part D plans. However, the health consequences of these policies for Medicare Part D beneficiaries who do not also (or did not in the past) have Medicaid coverage and who are not nursing home residents have not been well studied. The objectives of this project are to study the effect of utilization management policies on health and to disentangle the effect that denials of treatment due to utilization management have on health. We propose to study both overall prescription drug utilization and health outcomes as well as three specific clinical indications--diabetes, for whom effective drug therapy should prevent emergency room and hospital admissions due to elevated blood glucose; individuals with urinary tract infections; and pneumonia, which should, in most cases, be effectively treated in the outpatient setting with prescription drugs. To complete these objectives, we will analyze administrative claims data from the Medicare Parts A, B, and D programs, covering inpatient care, outpatient care, and prescription drugs, respectively.

20192048,SUpPress SSI: Single Use Negative Pressure Wound Therapy (NPWT) to Reduce Surgical Site Infections,"The proposed work: Specific aim 1 is to evaluate the effect of single-use negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) on surgical site infection (SSI) rates after C-section, abdominal hysterectomy, and colon procedures in at-risk patients. To address this aim, we will conduct a multicenter, stepped-wedge, quasi-experimental trial evaluating use of the PrevenaTM with 125 mmHg negative pressure for 7 days among obese (BMI >30) and/or diabetic patients undergoing the procedures of interest. This is an effectiveness trial evaluating the effect of single-use NPWT on SSI rates among high-risk patients using a randomized stepped-wedge design. Six Epicenter hospitals will be included: University of Illinois Hospital (UIH), University of Iowa Hospital and Clinics (UIHC), University of Utah Hospital (UUH), Emory University Hospital Midtown (EUHM), Grady Memorial Hospital (GMH), and University of Maryland Medical Center (UMMC). If proposed improvement in SSI rates are demonstrated, this will provide more clear guidance for the use of the NPWT. Specific aim 2 is to investigate the patients' experience of using the NPWT. A subset of patients will be surveyed to assess their knowledge of post-operative care, to identify complications associated with NPWT use, and to learn how patients evaluated the device's ease of use, ease of removal, and comfort. This will identify barriers to implementation. Specific aim 3 is to assess whether real-time decision support through machine learning modeling can help surgeons identify patients at high risk of SSI who could benefit from NPWT or other post-surgical preventive measures. This will evaluate whether boosted tree modeling techniques can be used ""at the bedside"" via electronic medical record data feeds to tailor post-operative care and preventive care for specific patients. Participating hospitals will be surveyed to assess their readiness to submit data to the datamart. We will sequentially establish the data feed for each hospital. From the datamart, a model will be built for SSIs that could be prevented by the NPWT. In this way, it will refine the predictive value of the model for this specific intervention. The use of this modeling will help provide more personalized care plans for patients at greatest risk of SSI.",1,1,,,,,,,single use negative pressure,1
20192159,"Examining the relationship of periodontal treatment and improved health outcomes for coronary heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, and diabetes","Limited evidence suggests that periodontal treatment may improve cardiovascular and diabetes outcomes in some groups. Despite these findings, critical gaps remain in our understanding of the relationship between periodontal disease and these medical conditions. The proposed study will utilize a relational database combining 12 years of medical, pharmacy, laboratory, dental, and insurance claims data from a large, community-based, integrated health system to explore whether treatment of periodontal disease can improve select medical outcomes and reduce medical costs when controlling for confounders not previously addressed in studies utilizing observational data. By leveraging longitudinal (repeated measures) data, we will have access to more relevant measures over longer follow-up times relative to previous reports. In addition, we will use additional statistical approaches--compared side by side with traditional epidemiological results--that, by design, aim to control for unmeasured confounders (e.g., attitudes, personality, unobserved health habits) that remain relatively stable over time or aim to leverage quasi-experimental properties in the data (i.e., instrumental variables) to approximate causal effects as if periodontal treatment were randomly assigned. We anticipate that effect estimates may be attenuated (or even eliminated) relative to previously reported results when confounding is better controlled for by using richer data and more sophisticated analytic methods afforded by those richer data. If previous findings hold up to our more robust probing, we believe the added confidence in those results will bring substantial value to informing clinical priority setting.",1,1,,,,,,,periodontal disease and cardiometabolic disease,1
20193167,Multi-component Intervention for Diabetes in Adults with Serious mental illness (MIDAS),"Serious mental illnesses (SMI), including schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and schizoaffective disorder, are associated with increased medical comorbidity and premature mortality from diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Unhealthy lifestyles, including energy-dense (obesogenic) diet, sedentary behavior, and cigarette smoking are important risk factors for diabetes and accelerated biological aging. All of these risk factors are potentially modifiable. There is considerable literature documenting the effectiveness of strategies to prevent and manage diabetes in the general population; yet, these interventions are rarely offered to people with SMI. Residential care facilities (RCFs), called board-and-care homes in California, are a common housing modality for patients with SMI; they provide a venue that can maximize efficiency and sustainability of a lifestyle intervention. The goals of the proposed four-year study are to tailor a multi-component intervention to this high-risk group. The study will be a hybrid effectiveness-implementation (hybrid type 1) trial of a Multi-component Intervention for Diabetes risk reduction in Adults with SMI (MIDAS) in licensed RCFs in San Diego county. As a hybrid type 1 study, the primary emphasis will be on determining the effectiveness of the intervention to achieve desired health outcomes while also systematically collecting data on its implementation within RCFs that will inform implementation strategy refinement. Main components of MIDAS include (1) education about diabetes and lifestyle, (2) dietary intervention at the facility and resident level, (3) increased physical activity, and (4) smoking cessation/reduction. We will employ a modified cluster-randomized, stepped-wedge, and adaptive trial design involving 210 residents with SMI and 120 staff members from 12 RCFs. The RCFs will be divided randomly into four cohorts of three RCFs each. Each cohort will be tested over a 15-month period that includes three phases: a three-month initial control phase (no intervention, from baseline month 0 to end of month 3), a six-month intervention phase (months 4 through 9), and a six-month follow-up phase (no intervention, months 10 through 15). All the study participants will be assessed quarterly during the 15-month period. Our investigators will train RCF staff (especially the activity director and cook) to increase physical activity and reduce smoking, and to implement healthful dietary modifications among the residents, using evidence-based interventions. During the intervention phase, the RCF activity director will conduct twice-weekly manualized group sessions on education about diabetes, nutrition, exercise, and smoking cessation/reduction, to deliver a multi-component group intervention. We will also explore if there are improvements in blood-based research biomarkers of insulin resistance and inflammation in the RCF residents with SMI. This project is responsive to RFA-MH-17-608 and related to National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) Strategic Objective #3.3B: testing interventions for effectiveness in community practice settings. If successful, MIDAS will be sustained and disseminated, and would lead to reduction in excess medical comorbidity and mortality associated with SMI.",1,1,1,,,,,,SMI patients and caregivers,1
20193190,Improving diabetes outcomes and health disparities through a patient activation intervention addressing unmet resource needs,"Despite the high importance patients place on the role of cost in their care, evidence-based, scalable interventions are needed to address prevalent health-related financial burdens and unmet social determinants of health (SDHs) that impair the ability of adults with uncontrolled diabetes to adhere to effectively manage their condition. Solutions need to optimize the time of busy providers and overburdened delivery systems to address complex patient needs. The long-term goal of this research is to improve health behaviors and outcomes by better engaging patients in care, and to develop effective mechanisms that identify and address their unmet SDHs and health-related financial burdens that contribute to adverse health outcomes. In this study, we will refine and test the effectiveness of Care$olutions--an automated e-health tool for tailored screening of health-related financial burdens and unmet SDHs that informs and activates patients with uncontrolled diabetes to take steps in accessing resources and engaging in self-care. Our central hypothesis is that activating patients with uncontrolled diabetes and linking them to resources to address financial burden and unmet SDHs will improve both intermediate outcomes and measures of disease control (e.g., HbA1c) above and beyond existing services, especially for high-need patients. Guided by strong preliminary data, this hypothesis will be tested by pursuing two specific aims: 1) determine the effectiveness of Care$olutions relative to existing services in order to improve glycemic control and patient-centered outcomes such as cost-related non-adherence (CRN) behaviors and perceived financial burdens; and 2) use quantitative methods to examine the role of patient risk factors (moderators) and behavioral factors (e.g., uptake and use of resources) (mediators) on the effectiveness of Care$olutions in improving outcomes. We will use user-centered design to ensure that features of Care$olutions provide long-term sustainability. A total of 720 patients with uncontrolled diabetes (type 1 and type 2) who engage in CRN or perceive financial burden will be recruited from the University of Michigan Diabetes Registry and randomized to receive a 15- to 20-minute web-based program with routine follow-up (Care$olutions), versus contact information for existing assistance services in the health system. Outcomes will be assessed at baseline and 6- and 12-month follow-up via survey data (validated with health records) and HbA1c assessments. The proposed research is innovative because it provides a comprehensive, low-literacy e-health tool to guide patients through identification of health-related financial burdens and unmet SDHs that impact disease management, links them directly to resources, and provides training to address needs with providers. It addresses a significant gap in care by evaluating an approach to addressing patient needs that optimizes their health and the time of providers. The proposed research is significant because it is expected to yield an evidence-based scalable method to address resource needs of socioeconomically vulnerable populations to improve treatment adherence, reduce health disparities, and diabetes complications.",1,1,,,,,,,e health tool to screen for financial burden,1
20191066,Leveraging modern analytic approaches to improve diabetes outcomes,"Diabetic patients are at risk of developing diabetic heart disease, which may lead to complications in care. Diabetic heart disease patients not only have exceptionally high health care expenditures and resource utilization but also are likely to have poor patient outcomes. Studies have shown that early intervention of patients likely to develop diabetic heart disease is cost-effective and yields favorable health outcomes. Therefore, early identification of diabetic patients at high risk of developing diabetic heart disease is crucial to provide effective interventions. The commonly accepted methodology for diabetic heart disease risk prediction is the use of one or more risk scoring systems. However, these risk functions may not generalize well for the diabetes patient and may suffer from poor calibration when used on different cohorts. Moreover, the scoring systems have only been studied on coronary heart disease, one variant of diabetic heart disease, while heart failure and diabetic cardiomyopathy remain important, yet insufficiently studied, problems. Machine learning offers the ability to perform accurate predictive analytics and has been proposed as a way to identify and manage high-risk patients. The primary goal of this proposal is to develop a high-impact and practical risk prediction model that can be used to perform early identification of high-risk diabetic heart disease patients. Given the heterogeneity and complexity of patient information in electronic health records, the model needs to capitalize on the multidimensional temporal nature of patient records to extract identifying characteristics of patients that will develop diabetic heart disease. To accomplish this, we will leverage modern machine learning approaches such as tensor factorization and natural language processing to model complex patient characteristics, provide a more complete representation of the patient, and uncover excellent predictors of diabetic heart disease risk. An existing dataset that contains the de-identified electronic health records of approximately 4,100 diabetic patients from the Emory Healthcare System will be used to compare the predictive power of machine learning-based algorithms with the standard risk scoring systems. These algorithms will be evaluated on calibration, discrimination, and ease of interpretability. The results of this work will provide insight as to how to develop a machine learning-based prediction system that can identify high-risk diabetic heart disease patients. The study may also shed light on the best approaches for fusing data from multiple heterogeneous sources to build a better predictive model and potentially identify novel indicators of high-risk diabetic heart disease factors. Moreover, the work will help inform a larger multisite study of diabetic heart disease risk prediction and develop methods to generalize the results to a broader spectrum of comorbidities. This project is consistent with the National Library of Medicine's mission to translate biomedical research into practice.",1,,,,,,1,,risk prediction model,1
20193472,Comparative effectiveness of adding family supporter training and engagement to a community health worker (CHW)-led intervention to improve behavioral management of multiple risk factors for diabetes complications,"Challenges to controlling blood glucose, blood pressure, and cholesterol levels put 16 million U.S. adults at high risk of disabling diabetes complications. Diabetes self-management (DSM) interventions have struggled to deliver relevant, effective, and sustainable support for at-risk adults with diabetes to improve multiple key DSM behaviors, become more activated participants in health care, and reduce diabetes complications. One largely untapped resource for this support is patients' family and friends. Seventy-five percent of adults with diabetes reach out to an unpaid family member or friend (a family supporter) for ongoing help with diabetes management. However, diabetes management interventions to date lack structured and tested approaches to directly engage patients' supportive family members in promoting and sustaining patient activation and improved diabetes management. The objective of this study is to compare the effectiveness of a novel strategy--Family Partners for Health Action (FAM-ACT)--to individual patient-focused diabetes self-management education (DSME) and care management. FAM-ACT directly engages family supporters of at-risk adults with diabetes by providing them the core skills to allow them to effectively support health behavior change, medication adherence, and active engagement with patient's health care providers. A fundamental focus of FAM-ACT is providing family with the ability to give autonomy supportive and need-responsive help to patients. Community health workers (CHWs) will deliver FAM-ACT to low-income patients and their family supporters, plus take the novel step of helping family supporters integrate their efforts with those of patients' primary care teams. The specific aims of this study are to 1) compare the effect of FAM-ACT on patients' diabetes health outcomes to standard, individually focused, CHW-led DSME and care management (DSME+CM); 2) compare the effect of FAM-ACT on patient health behaviors and perceived support to standard, individually focused DSME+CM; and 3) examine whether health and health behavior gains made in FAM-ACT are better sustained after the intervention period than those made in DSME+CM. A total of 240 patient + family member pairs will be randomized to FAM-ACT or DSME+CM for 12 months. Main diabetes health outcomes will include change from baseline to 12 months in UKPDS (United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study) 5-year cardiac risk score, HbA1c, and systolic blood pressure. Main patient behavioral outcomes will include diabetes self-management behaviors, and perceived social support and autonomy supportiveness from family. Sustainability will be assessed at 18 months, after a period of 6 months without CHW intervention. We expect this study to produce an innovative, evidence-based protocol and tool set that leverages family support to help patients optimize and sustain management of multiple diabetes complication risk factors over time. This project is innovative because it provides family supporters with underlying support, communication, and health behavior facilitation techniques that can be applied to improving and sustaining multiple healthy behaviors underlying diabetes management, combines the potential additional effectiveness and sustainability of effective family support with the demonstrated effectiveness of CHWs, and integrates family support with patient-centered medical care.",1,1,1,,,,,,family and individual self management,1
20183164,Advancing chronic condition symptom cluster science through use of electronic health records and data science techniques,"Despite their adverse impact on patient quality of life and health care utilization and costs, symptom clusters (SCs) in common adult chronic conditions such as cancer, heart failure (HF), type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are understudied and poorly understood. The lack of access to real-world, longitudinal patient symptom data sets and inability to adequately model the complexity of SCs have greatly limited research. Based on our previous work, we propose that these gaps can be addressed in an innovative way using electronic health records (EHRs) and data science techniques. Our overall objective is to develop, apply and refine, and implement an optimized data processing and analysis pipeline for the characterization of SCs in common adult chronic conditions for use with EHR data. We hypothesize that a core set of SCs is shared among all common adult chronic conditions and that distinct SCs characterize specific conditions and/or treatments. The long-term training goal of this project is to assist Dr. Koleck in becoming an independent investigator conducting a program of research dedicated to mitigating symptom burden in patients with chronic conditions through use of informatics and omics (e.g., genomics and proteomics), the focus of her pre-doctoral work. Using exceptional resources available from Columbia University, the K99 phase of this project will focus on the development of a rigorous pipeline; essential competencies in SC analysis and interpretation; and the data science techniques of clinical data mining, natural language processing, machine learning, and data visualization. In the R00 phase, Dr. Koleck will independently implement the pipeline in another medical center to determine the reproducibility of identified SCs and begin to explore clinical predictors (e.g., socio-demographics, laboratory results, and medications) of SCs. The specific aims are to 1) develop a data-driven pipeline for the characterization of SCs from EHRs using a cohort of adult patients diagnosed with cancer, as SCs have been most systematically characterized in this condition; 2) apply the pipeline to three other common adult chronic conditions that share biological and behavioral risk factors with cancer, i.e., HF, T2DM, and COPD, and evaluate SCs in these conditions; and 3) determine if SCs differ for cancer, HF, T2DM, and COPD when implementing the pipeline within another medical center and explore clinically relevant, EHR-documented predictors of identified SCs. To accomplish research aims and training goals, an interdisciplinary team of scientists with expertise in symptom science, biomedical informatics, data science, pertinent clinical domains, and career development mentorship has been assembled. This research is significant because a pipeline that accommodates the format in which symptom data is already being documented in EHRs has the potential to greatly accelerate the acquisition of SC knowledge and expedite clinical translation of symptom mitigation strategies. Given the array of new competencies to be developed, this K99/R00 award is necessary for achieving the candidate's career goal of advancing chronic condition symptom science.",1,,,,,,1,,symptom cluster identifiecation with ML,1
20191144,Practical Telemedicine to Improve Control and Engagement for Veterans with Clinic-Refractory Diabetes Mellitus (PRACTICE-DM),"This study will evaluate a comprehensive telemedicine intervention for veterans with persistently poor diabetes control despite clinic-based Veterans Health Administration (VHA) care. Because this approach is designed for delivery via existing home telehealth (HT) services, which are ubiquitous throughout VHA, it may represent an effective, practical alternative for veterans whose diabetes is refractory to clinic-based care. Although efforts by clinicians and researchers have improved diabetes control across VHA, veterans with persistent poorly controlled diabetes mellitus (PPDM) have not benefitted from these advances. We define PPDM as maintenance of a hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) 8.5% for >1 year, despite receiving clinic-based diabetes care during this period. Veterans meeting this definition--approximately 12% of all veterans with type 2 diabetes--contribute disproportionately to VHA's burden of diabetes complications and costs. While clinic-based care is insufficiently effective in PPDM, telemedicine-based management that comprehensively addresses factors underlying poor diabetes control could improve outcomes for these high-risk veterans. Unfortunately, health care systems have rarely integrated comprehensive telemedicine-based care into real-world practice, even for clinic-refractory conditions like PPDM. This gap stems from the fact that comprehensive telemedicine-based diabetes care has not previously been designed for practical delivery under real-world conditions. In order for telemedicine to fulfill its potential as a means to reduce the burden of PPDM, interventions must be developed with an emphasis on feasible delivery through existing workforce, infrastructure, and technical resources, such that effective implementation is eventually achievable. Until then, veterans with PPDM will be left without alternatives when clinic-based care proves inadequate. Objectives: The proposed trial will evaluate Practical Telemedicine to Improve Control and Engagement for Veterans with Clinic-Refractory Diabetes Mellitus (PRACTICE-DM), a novel, comprehensive telemedicine intervention for PPDM that is designed for practical delivery within VHA. The specific aims of this study are to 1) determine PRACTICE-DM's effectiveness; 2) evaluate PRACTICE-DM's acceptability and mechanisms of effect using a mixed-method process evaluation; and 3) understand costs associated with PRACTICE-DM. Methods: Two hundred veterans with PPDM from two sites (Durham, North Carolina and Richmond, Virginia) will be randomized to receive one of two HT-delivered interventions: 1) PRACTICE-DM, a comprehensive intervention combining telemonitoring, self-management support, diet/activity support, medication management, and depression support; or 2) an active control, standard HT care coordination and telemonitoring. Both interventions will be delivered over a 12-month period and all participants will continue to receive usual VHA care. The primary study outcome will be change in HbA1c from study baseline to 12 months. The secondary outcomes are guided by a theoretical framework, and will include diabetes self-care, diabetes burden, self-efficacy, and depressive symptoms. Qualitative interviews will be conducted with 20 intervention-group veterans, the HT nurses delivering the intervention, and administrators at each site. Intervention costs will be comprehensively assessed and compared to standard HT care coordination and telemonitoring. Findings: None to date. Impact: Although VHA is a leader in telemedicine, its telemedicine capabilities are currently underutilized for veterans with PPDM. These veterans are refractory to clinic-based care, so contribute disproportionately to diabetes complications and costs. This study will leverage VHA's unique telemedicine infrastructure to deliver comprehensive management designed for PPDM, with the goal of improving outcomes in this high-risk, high-cost population. Because the proposed intervention is designed for delivery using existing HT services, it may represent an effective, practical approach to reducing the burden of poor diabetes control across VHA.",1,1,1,,,,,,telemedicine intervention  ,1
20184142,Direct and indirect effects of direct-to-consumer advertising,"In the United States, at least 92% of older adults suffer from at least one chronic condition, and 77% have at least two. Individuals are increasingly expected to take control of chronic condition management by integrating the optimal mix of prescription drugs, outpatient utilization, and health-related behaviors, like diet, exercise, and over-the-counter drugs. Additionally, individuals with chronic illness are increasingly turning to alternative methods of managing their health, such as dietary supplements (vitamins, minerals, herbal products, etc.), with 75% of those 55 and older taking at least one dietary supplement on a daily basis. Greater consumer control in decision making relies on consumers being informed about the costs and efficacy of various health inputs, and in this environment direct-to-consumer advertising (DTCA) plays a vital role. U.S. consumers are being exposed to unprecedented high levels of DTCA. Prescription drug DTCA reached $5.63 billion in 2015, and $850 million was spent on dietary supplement DTCA in that year. Our prior work and the work of others shows that the increase in DTCA is an important factor contributing to rising utilization rates of prescription drugs and dietary supplements. While the direct effects of DTCA are well established, less is known about how this market-driven information (advertising) affects the totality of an individual's allocation towards all healthcare inputs. On one hand, DTCA might promote a culture of health and increase the likelihood of drug adherence, diet, or exercise. On the other hand, DTCA might promote potentially dangerous substitutions, with consumers being persuaded that drugs and dietary supplements can cure all disease without complementary lifestyle behaviors. We propose to study 1) how increased exposure to prescription drug DTCA affects spillovers in the formal healthcare setting (outpatient use); 2) how exposure to dietary supplement DTCA affects spillovers in the formal healthcare setting; 3) how exposure to prescription drug DTCA impacts health-related behaviors (e.g., diet and exercise); and 4) how exposure to dietary supplement DTCA impacts health-related behaviors. We will examine these questions through case study conditions that are highly prevalent in United States, including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, depression, and osteoarthritis. We will use comprehensive data on advertising and healthcare utilization from Nielsen, Ingenix, Kantar Media, and Simmons. We will exploit natural experiments (introduction of Medicare Part D and differences across advertising boundaries) and carefully control for ad targeting in order to produce causal estimates. Only two countries in the world allow for DTCA (the U.S. and New Zealand). This study can produce critical new information about the direct and indirect effects of DTCA on health and healthcare spending, which will allow for policymakers to better understand both the benefits and costs associated with DTCA.",1,,,,1,,,,direct-to-consumer advertising,1
20191082,Impact of neighborhood and workforce deprivation on diabetes outcomes in veterans: a spatio-temporal analysis,"Diabetes is the seventh-leading cause of death in the United States, can lead to serious complications, and is associated with increased health care costs. Prevalence estimates for veterans show a disproportionate burden of disease, with estimates close to 25%, as compared to 8% of the general US population. Evidence consistently shows racial minorities have a higher prevalence of diabetes, worse outcomes, higher risk of complications, and higher mortality rate compared to non-Hispanic whites. This disparity persists after controlling for patient-level factors such as education, income, knowledge, health literacy, and self-efficacy; provider-level factors, such as bias, communication, and trust; and system-level factors, such as access to care. Little attention has been given to differences that may be explained by regional variation in patient-level resources, community-level resources, and health workforce resources. Objectives: This study seeks to identify and explain spatial and temporal variation in health outcomes, community resources, Veterans Affairs (VA) workforce capacity, and health disparities among patients with type 2 diabetes. Aim 1 will examine spatiotemporal trends in diabetes outcomes, including metabolic control, cost, and mortality. Aim 2 will develop a new spatiotemporal neighborhood deprivation index and examine its association with diabetes outcomes and racial disparities. Aim 3 will develop and validate a novel geographic workforce deprivation index to examine its association with diabetes outcomes and racial disparities. Methods: We will construct a cohort of veterans with type 2 diabetes receiving either inpatient or outpatient care at the VA during the years 2000 through 2015 by linking multiple patient and administrative files from the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) National Patient Care and Pharmacy Benefits Management databases, using a previously validated VA algorithm. Using advanced geographic information system (GIS) and spatial statistical methods, we will examine spatiotemporal trends in diabetes outcomes among veterans with type 2 diabetes. In aim 1, we will develop a flexible Bayesian spatiotemporal model to identify hotspots of high prevalence of diabetes-related outcomes. In aims 2 and 3, we will use spatiotemporal latent factor models to develop novel neighborhood and workforce deprivation indices, allowing us to investigate evolving patterns in community resource availability and VA workforce capacity. Completion of these aims will enable the VA to identify individual, community, and institutional factors associated with poor diabetes outcomes and to target community and system-level efforts to improve health in low-resource areas. Findings: No findings to date, project was just awarded May 1, 2018. Impact: This project will put forth a comprehensive geospatial framework to address the VA Blueprint for Excellence Strategy 3: Leverage information technologies, analytics, and models of health care to optimize individual well-being and population health outcomes. By creating a spatially referenced dataset incorporating health information, workforce productivity, and neighborhood deprivation, we will develop a comprehensive database to examine multiple dimensions of diabetes care. Through the use of advanced GIS and spatiotemporal statistics, we will identify hotspots of high disease risk, poor neighborhood resources, and low VA workforce capacity. This information will improve access to care by helping VA policy makers better match resources to areas with poor outcomes. Finally, by pinpointing areas with excessive health expenditures, the VA can develop cost-reduction measures to improve veterans' health while containing costs.",1,,,,1,,,,"workforce capacity of health systems, neighborhood resources",1
20183142,Impact of disparities in food security on glycemic control and health care utilization among youth and young adults with diabetes,"Despite recent advances in therapy, far too many youth and young adults (YYAs) with type 1 diabetes (T1D) and type 2 diabetes (T2D), particularly those of minority race/ethnicity, do not achieve optimal glycemic control, thus placing them at increased risk of acute and chronic complications. Among the social determinants of health, household food insecurity (HFI) may be a key barrier to achieving glycemic control and may lead to increased health care utilization and costs, but virtually all of the limited research was cross-sectional and conducted in older adults with T2D. Moreover, racial/ethnic minorities are disproportionately affected by HFI, which may underlie similar disparities in diabetes outcomes. Our preliminary work suggests that HFI is a common phenomenon in YYAs with diabetes, affecting 19% of YYAs with T1D and 38% of those with T2D. These rates significantly exceed the 2015 national estimate of 12.7%. We propose a longitudinal study, the SEARCH Food Security (SFS) cohort study, which is designed as an ancillary study to the ongoing CDC/DDT- and NIH/NIDDK-funded SEARCH for Diabetes in Youth 4 study, a racially/ethnically diverse study of diabetes diagnosed in youth. The aims of the SFS study are to (1) initiate a food insecurity cohort study of 1,187 YYAs aged 15-35 years (53% minority) with T1D and T2D by adding two data collection time points to the ongoing SEARCH 4 study; (2) prospectively evaluate the influence of HFI on changes in glycemic control in YYAs with T1D and T2D; (3) quantify the mediating role of nutritional, mental health, and behavioral pathways through which food insecurity may affect changes in glycemic control in YYAs with T1D and T2D; and (4) prospectively evaluate the influence of HFI on changes in health care utilization and medical and non-medical health care costs in YYAs with T1D and T2D. Using the SFS data in tandem with extensive data collected by SEARCH will be highly efficient for addressing these aims. The proposed study will be the first cohort study to examine the impact of food insecurity on glycemic control, health care utilization, and costs among a diverse population of US YYAs with T1D and T2D. Our transdisciplinary team is led by Drs. Liese and Mendoza, recognized experts in diabetes, epidemiology, pediatric medicine, disparities, and food insecurity research, and is supported by a team comprising expertise in pediatric endocrinology, psychology, health behaviors, health economics, biostatistics, and causal inference modeling. The study has the potential to alter diabetes policy and clinical practice by establishing the need for more in-depth assessments of food insecurity among YYAs with diabetes, re-assessment of diabetes management, and nutrition recommendations for food-insecure patients, and integration of food assistance resources into routine care for persons with diabetes. It will also inform the tailoring of interventions to address food insecurity, especially for minorities, in future diabetes research trials.",1,,1,,,,,,household food insecurity,1
20184041,Cheyenne River Sioux tribe cooking for health,"The research activities proposed in this application address a pressing need in American Indian (AI) communities--the design, implementation, and evaluation of a culturally tailored healthy food budgeting, purchasing, and cooking intervention to improve diet and health among AIs with type 2 diabetes. The premise of the proposed project was informed by pilot work in the community related to the availability of healthy foods, dietary choices, and food purchasing patterns, and previous studies that indicate positive relationships of budgeting and cooking skills training on diet and health in other adult populations. Currently, no evidence-based budgeting or cooking skills programs exist that can be implemented in low-resource settings, such as rural AI communities. Moreover, despite diet being a cornerstone of diabetes control, no budgeting or cooking skills programs exist that focus on individuals with type 2 diabetes. Using a randomized controlled trial, we will test the effectiveness of a culturally tailored healthy food budgeting, purchasing, and cooking program on (1) diet (i.e., intake of sugar-sweetened beverages [SSBs], processed foods); and (2) healthy food self-efficacy, budgeting and cooking skills, and healthy food purchases among AIs with type 2 diabetes who reside on the Cheyenne River Sioux reservation--the fourth largest AI reservation in the United States. Secondary outcomes will include other dietary factors (i.e., intake of vegetables and fruit, legumes, and whole grains), healthy food knowledge, nutrition label reading, diet-sensitive cardiometabolic risk factors (i.e., weight, waist circumference, blood pressure, lipids), and diabetes control (i.e., fasting glucose, HbA1c, diabetes medication use/dosage). Additionally, we will conduct a mixed-methods process evaluation to assess intervention reach, fidelity, participant satisfaction, and effectiveness. A curriculum will be tailored to an AI population with diabetes, and directly address major barriers to healthy eating that were identified by community members and tribal leaders in recent focus groups, including (1) difficulty budgeting for food on low incomes; (2) low literacy and numeracy when purchasing food (e.g., inability to use in-store scales to convert foods priced ""per pound"" to dollar values); and (3) limited cooking skills. We expect that development and implementation of a culturally tailored diet intervention will be effective in promoting positive diet change, and increase healthy food self-efficacy, budgeting and cooking skills, and healthy food purchases. Poorly controlled diabetes affects the health/longevity of those afflicted and has profound effects on health care costs. Greater efforts are needed to encourage healthy eating in underserved communities with a high burden of diabetes. Improving healthy food budgeting, purchasing, and cooking skills among AIs with diabetes should improve diet and diabetes management. If successful, this program can be extended to other AI communities.",1,1,,,,,,,culturally tailored food budgeting intervention,1
20183086,"Detecting, understanding, and reducing Diabetes Belt preventive care disparities","The economic costs of diabetes are huge with $176 billion in direct medical costs in 2012 and over 30% of Medicare expenditures spent on persons with diabetes. Of all health care expenditures attributed to diabetes, only 14% are spent to treat diabetes itself and the rest are spent to treat diabetic complications. Prevention of diabetic complications is important to reduce the economic burden of diabetes on national health care expenditures. American Diabetes Association (ADA) guidelines recommend preventive care to reduce the risk of these complications. Because these complications disproportionately affect the elderly, preventive care is also a special area of concern for the Centers of Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). Reducing health disparities and improving rates of preventive care utilization is national priority as reflected in Healthy People 2020 objectives to reduce health disparities and improve rates of diabetes preventive care (Objectives D4-D14). The ""Diabetes Belt"" is a recently identified group of counties with especially high diabetes prevalence (>=11% compared to 8.5% average in the rest of the country). The Diabetes Belt is comprised of two medically disadvantaged populations, namely, low-income whites in Appalachia and blacks in the rural South. These populations have high mortality risk which is mainly attributable to high chronic disease burden. Our analysis of 2008-2010 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) data shows that elderly persons (ages >= 65 years) with diabetes in the Diabetes Belt had almost 30% lower uptake of diabetes preventive services, such as annual foot exam, annual eye exam, and diabetes self-management education, compared to their counterparts in the rest of the country. They also had 12-23% higher rates of diabetes-related comorbidities, such as heart attack, stroke, and health-related disability, than those outside the Belt. The proposed study is a comprehensive research program that involves detecting, understanding, and reducing disparities in diabetes preventive care between the counties in the Diabetes Belt and the surrounding areas and within the Diabetes Belt itself. Detection involves measuring disparities in preventive service use and diabetic complications using Medicare claims data. Understanding involves identifying individual-level and county-level determinants of disparities. Finally, the third phase, ""reducing,"" involves developing optimal policy options using Markov decision process (MDP) analysis. In addition to the traditional factors such as race/ethnicity, income, access to care, and health care supply, we will evaluate the role of public policy (e.g., annual wellness visits) and local community partnerships in reducing disparities in diabetes preventive care use. In addition, we propose to use ""efficiency"" in producing preventive services such as a new ""metric"" to measure disparities and to identify areas of targeted action.",1,1,1,,1,,,,"individual and county level factors, markov model to ID policy solutions",1
20181592,Comparing patient-centered outcomes of standardized vs. patient-driven diabetes shared medical appointments,"Type II diabetes is a prevalent chronic disease with poor outcomes, and requires daily self-care, including blood glucose monitoring, following a diabetes friendly diet, engaging in regular physical activity, and medication adherence. Patients with diabetes benefit from comprehensive diabetes self-management education (DSME) and self-management support (SMS) in primary care. Shared medical appointments (SMAs) are one way to efficiently and effectively provide DSME and SMS. SMAs can have a variety of different features, but it is not known which features are most effective for which types of patients. Patients and other stakeholders engaged in planning this study proposed a model with diabetes ""veterans"" (i.e., diabetes peer mentors) co-facilitating group visits with a variety of diabetes care professionals, and then working one-on-one with patients to help apply what they learned. The group visit curriculum should include topics on physical activity, healthy eating, taking medication, acceptance and coping, and social support, and each cohort of patients should get to select topics most relevant to them. The practice stakeholders want to do more comprehensive group visit models, but need to know the extent to which SMA participation and patient-centered outcomes are improved compared to the more common standardized approaches they tend to use now. In this proposed study, we will compare the effectiveness of patient-driven diabetes SMAs to standardized diabetes SMAs. The curriculum to be used is Targeted Training for Illness Management (TTIM), a 12-session modular group intervention for chronic illness self-management, and has been tested in diabetes. The standardized group visit model will consist of diabetes SMAs with the full TTIM 12 session curriculum, led by a health educator. For the patient-driven SMAs, patients choose the topics and the order of sessions from TTIM the curriculum, which is delivered collaboratively by the multidisciplinary care team consisting of several professional providers (health educator, medical provider, and behavioral health provider) and a lay worker (diabetes peer mentor). The primary patient-centered outcome, selected by patient stakeholders, is diabetes distress. Secondary outcomes include autonomy support, quality of life, and diabetes self-management behaviors, clinical outcomes (hemoglobin A1c, blood pressure, and body mass index), patient reach and engagement, and practice level value and sustainability. Patient, caregiver, practice, health plans, and research stakeholders will be engaged in all aspects of the research. Patients and other stakeholders will inform the process of implementation of patient-driven and standardized SMAs, help finalize the research protocol (including data collection and recruitment), and contribute to interpretation of findings and dissemination of findings, including messages that help other patients make decisions about whether or not to participate in SMAs.",1,,1,,,,,,group visits diabetes self-management systems,1
20182476,Evaluation of clinical trajectories and identification of modifiable risk factors to improve secondary prevention of amputation in veterans with diabetes following an initial toe amputation,"Background: Toe amputations are often naively viewed as an inconsequential surgical procedure with little functional impact. Instead, a toe amputation is often the inciting event in a cascade of progressive loss of function and quality of life. One in three people undergoing toe amputations due to chronic illness fail to heal the amputation in a timely manner, requiring additional amputation surgery(ies), and one in five dies in the following year. Inadequate healing may be related to suboptimal management of comorbid conditions. Veterans with limited social support may be further limited in their ability to self-manage their illness and engage in treatment to facilitate healing and prevent additional amputation. Veterans who undergo repeated amputations lose functional life years during repeated treatments and recoveries. Objectives: The aims of this study are to 1) to characterize amputation trajectories and evaluate trends in subsequent amputation and death in the year after initial toe amputation overall, based on demographic characteristics, selected clinical factors (e.g., vascular status), and geographic location (e.g., Veterans Integrated Service Networks [VISN]); 2) to evaluate the associations between modifiable risk factors and 1-year risk of subsequent amputation or death while controlling for important risk factors that confound these associations; and 3) to acquire knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors related to secondary prevention using semi-structured interviews among patients who have undergone a toe amputation and providers who care for these patients to develop future interventions that improve outcomes in these patients. Methods: We will accomplish these goals by using VA electronic medical record data, and in-depth interviews with providers and patients. Our proposed research--a retrospective cohort study including all VHA patients (~20,000) with diabetes with a first ever toe amputation between FY 2005 and 2016--will be the largest study conducted to date, national in scope, and will supplement structured data with unstructured data to ascertain key information about not only the amputation but also other relevant patient characteristics. For aim 1, frequencies and percentages of the following clinical outcomes will be obtained: subsequent amputation within 1, 6, and 12 months; counts of subsequent amputations; the final level of amputation at 12 months; and death. We will formally test for trends across time by including year as a predictor variable in logistic regression models, considering the use of piece-wise regression to allow for non-linear trends. Similar models will be constructed to test for variation across VISN. Key modifiable risk factors for aim 2 include behavioral factors (e.g., smoking, alcohol misuse), revascularization procedure and type, and adequacy of treatment of mental health conditions. For aim 3, we will conduct in-depth interviews with providers and patients who have and have not undergone a subsequent amputation, to gain insight into patient- and system-level barriers to successful healing, policies or other activities that could improve care for patients who undergo a toe amputation, and patient and provider perspectives on factors that they think would lead to improved patient outcomes. Findings: We have no findings to report at this time. Impact: By conducting a detailed evaluation of temporal and geographic variation, identification of modifiable risk factors, and interviews with patients and providers, we will understand system-level and individual-level variation in outcomes. Our study will lay the groundwork to improve amputation prevention at VA.",1,1,,,,,,,toe amputation effects,1

For over a decade efficacious 6- and 12-month Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) lifestyle interventions have been translated successfully and demonstrated positive impact. However, efforts to develop and evaluate potentially scalable programs conforming to current guidelines for longer-term DPP interventions (up to 24 months) and help a greater proportion of enrollees achieve and sustain the recommended weight loss target of >= 5% are lacking. Our scientific premise is that the evaluation of translational DPP interventions, which has centered largely on strategies for weight loss induction, must be extended to include longer-term interventions that clearly demonstrate durable weight, cardiometabolic, and functional health benefits especially for vulnerable elders in community-based settings. Our previous DPP-based research has documented the utility of telephone follow-up after a 6-month DPP weight loss induction and shown that 63% of a 65- to 80-year-old volunteer sample with obesity and other risk factors were able to sustain >= 5% weight loss at 12 months. Despite good evidence that longer duration lifestyle interventions yield better outcomes (reflected in the latest Medicare ruling) there are no translational studies of 24-month long DPP interventions with older adults. We now propose to utilize community-based settings to examine whether we can sustain the impact of an elder-focused DPP approach using potentially scalable treatment components over a 24-month period. We will recruit and enroll 65- to 80-year-old adults with obesity and pre-diabetes (N=360) from a network of senior community centers that provide aging services. The intervention program sequencing will be aligned with current Medicare policy. First, from 0-6 months, experienced lifestyle coaches will administer a DPP-video intervention anchored primarily by telephone coaching for all participants, at least 25% from ethnic/racial minority groups. Next, participants, will be randomized (N=180 per arm; stratified by weight loss of < or >= 5%) to one of two 18-month follow-up conditions conducted between 6-24 months. We will compare the effects of (1) DPP-Sustained (DPP-S) and (2) DPP-Minimal (DPP-M) on measures of weight/adiposity (the primary outcome) at 12, 18, and 24 months. In addition, we will collect cardiometabolic, physical activity, physical function, psychosocial, behavioral, and other age-sensitive quality of life measures at 12 and 18 and 24 months. Medicare claims data will also be examined for a proportion of the sample regarding medication use, outpatient, inpatient, and emergency visits and enrollment/participation in elder-focused activity programs. This work, if successful, will have immediate potential for DPP-based lifestyle interventions, which are consistent with a chronic care model, and will benefit vulnerable aging individuals and society.",1,,1,,,,,,DPP sustained,1
20183244,Investigating self-management of the dual diagnosis of HIV and diabetes,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is common among persons living with HIV (PLWH), with a prevalence of 10-15%. This rate may be higher in racial and ethnic minority populations. For PLWH who have T2DM (PLWH+T2DM), subpar self-management of either condition can lead to serious complications. Patients can improve morbidity and mortality by engaging in effective self-management but the regimens for managing both HIV and T2DM are complex and extensive. At minimum, patients with T2DM must learn to manage a diabetic diet, take DM medications, monitor blood glucose, perform daily physical activity, and monitor foot problems. PLWH must take HIV medications, monitor for opportunistic infections, and prevent transmission to others. Factors that influence T2DM self-management can be contextual (gender, race/ethnicity), motivational (self-efficacy, social support, depression), psychological (stress, anxiety, depression), and behavioral (diet, self-monitoring, adherence to exercise and treatment regimen). In this mixed-methods study, using a simplified diabetes management model, we will examine (1) factors that predict self-management behaviors and outcomes in PLWH+T2DM and clinical outcomes, using a de-identified patient medical records dataset; and (2) patients' perspectives of self-management challenges. The Center for AIDS Research (CFAR) Network of Integrated Clinical Systems (CNICS) will provide the quantitative data for ~3,100 PLWH+T2DM within a larger cohort of >31,000 PLWH. To verify significant variables in this cohort and to address variables not included in the dataset, we will conduct 30 qualitative semi-structured interviews with PLWH+T2DM recruited from local HIV care clinics and volunteer organizations regarding their perspectives on barriers and facilitators related to self-management.",1,1,,,,,,,diabetes self management among HIV patients,1
20191569,Reconociendo las raices (recognizing the roots): Hispanic ethnic heterogeneity in reported and measured hypertension and diabetes,"The Hispanic population in the U.S. aged 65 and older has been growing rapidly and is projected to increase 5-fold between 2012 and 2050, when Hispanics are expected to make up more than 18% of the older adult population. Hypertension and diabetes are major diseases that affect a growing number of aging Hispanics and present significant health challenges to this population. Disease diagnosis is often the basis for estimating prevalence of hypertension and diabetes in the population. People of Hispanic origin, however, are at greater risk of underdiagnosis because of the unique challenges they face accessing and interacting with the health care system. The main objectives of the proposed project are two-fold: 1) to obtain estimates of hypertension and diabetes prevalence for different Hispanic subpopulations, defined by ethnic origin, nativity, and time in the U.S.; and 2) to determine how sociocultural factors, health care access and utilization, and the sociomedical environment interact to influence risk for hypertension and diabetes. Data for this project come from the nationally representative Health and Retirement Study (HRS), which includes a large diverse sample of Hispanics, information on both disease diagnosis and direct assessments of disease risk, and contextual data on the social, economic, and health care environment. Multilevel modeling and logistic regression models will be used to 1) examine the association between sociocultural factors and reported and measured disease prevalence; 2) determine if variation in health insurance and health care utilization accounts for Hispanic group differences in hypertension and diabetes; and 3) determine if variation in the sociomedical environment account for Hispanic differences in hypertension and diabetes. Results from the proposed project will offer additional insight in the determinants of health and the factors that contribute to Hispanic health disparities.",1,1,1,,,,,,sociocultural factors among hispanics,1
20191121,Novel approaches to monitor the safety and effectiveness of newly marketed diabetes medications in older adults: considering frailty and multimorbidity,"This application for a mentored clinical scientist research career development award (K08) is submitted by Elisabetta Patorno, MD, DrPH, in response to PA-16-191. Dr. Patorno is a preventive medicine physician and pharmacoepidemiologist in the Division of Pharmacoepidemiology at Brigham and Women's Hospital, and assistant professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School. With a rapidly increasing US population >= 65 years, who use the largest proportion of medications, a better understanding of the effects of medications in older adults as used in routine care is imperative. This need is even more acute for new drugs that usually enter the market on the basis of evidence from relatively small, short, and often placebo-controlled randomized trials (RCTs), in which older patients are often underrepresented or excluded. As a result, clinicians often struggle choosing the best treatment for their older patients, particularly those with frailty and multimorbidity. Dr. Patorno is committed to a career as an independent clinical investigator, focused on advancing research for rigorously monitoring the effects of medications in older adults as treated in routine care. To achieve this, Dr. Patorno proposes a 4-year program of career development and mentored research centered on the development of a valid system for timely and high-quality evidence on new diabetes drugs in older patients specifically tailored to address the unique aspects of care in older patients, such as frailty and multimorbidity. This setting of research combines the urgent need for information on the effects of over 10 new antidiabetic agents approved by the FDA in the last decade with the need for the development of novel methods for prospective drug monitoring in real-world older adults. Within the highly productive and supportive research environment of the Division of Pharmacoepidemiology, Dr. Patorno will work with an interdisciplinary team of mentors and collaborators drawn from across institutions at Harvard University that have deep expertise and national/international reputations in the specific substantive areas of her proposed training: clinical geriatrics and diabetology, methods for prospective monitoring and data mining, and health services research in older populations. The overarching objective of her mentored research is to create and implement a novel approach for the near-real-time monitoring of the comparative safety and effectiveness of new diabetes drugs in older patients as treated in routine care. This novel monitoring approach will use Medicare claims data available with a relatively short lag time, linked to electronic medical records and the Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey. The proposed work will provide timely and actionable knowledge for clinicians treating older adults, defining the net incremental value of new antidiabetic agents in older patients with frailty and multimorbidity. The knowledge gained from this work will impact several million older adults in the US and will provide the applicant with a solid background to become an independent researcher, and ultimately a leader, in the study of medication use and outcomes in aging populations.",1,1,,,,,,,diabetes drugs in older adults,1
20182033,DVD lifestyle intervention (D-ELITE),"More than a third of US veterans who receive care through the VHA are obese, putting them at higher risk for multiple serious chronic health conditions. Developing evidence-based programs that are scalable, cost-efficient, and serve a diverse veteran population is a priority for the VA National Center for Health Promotion and Disease Prevention (NCP). While the VA's MOVE! program is an effective lifestyle intervention for obesity, its reach has been limited. Some veterans may best achieve weight loss with in-person group visits or by internet and mobile technology-intensive programs, while others may do better with a population-based, self-directed program that uses minimal technology. This trial will examine the effectiveness of a proven 12-month pragmatic self-directed, low-technology, and low-resource video-based lifestyle intervention targeting modest, clinically meaningful weight loss and increased physical activity among obese veterans. If successful, this trial may help ease the burden that obesity places on veterans and the health care system. Objectives: We will test whether the intervention will yield better outcomes for obese veterans compared with usual care (UC) controls, including (a) primary: greater weight loss and improved physical function after 12 months; and (b) secondary: improvements in sustained weight loss, physical function and activity, diet quality and self-efficacy, sleep disturbance and impairment, and blood pressure after 24 months. Methods: Using the VA Corporate Data Warehouse (CDW), we will identify veterans in the western US who are obese and likely free of major exclusionary conditions. We will mail an invitation to participate. For those who reply with interest, or do not respond, research staff will call the veteran to explain the study and obtain verbal consent, as appropriate. We will assess change in weight via CDW. For co-morbidities and other outcomes, participants will complete questionnaires at baseline, and 12 and 24 months after randomization. The lifestyle intervention is designed to achieve and maintain a weight loss of 5-10% of baseline body weight in a gradual stepwise fashion, and to gradually achieve at least 150 minutes per week of moderate-intensity physical activity, such as brisk walking. The intervention structure consists of watching one video each week for 12 weeks, focused on healthy eating, physical activity, and behavior change. Participants will track their food intake and physical activity, work through a series of supplementary handouts, and have access to a lifestyle coach as desired for the first 12 months. The study is powered on two continuous-scale endpoints, weight and SF-12. The two-sided type I error rate, =2.5%, was chosen to account for multiple comparisons using the Bonferroni adjustment. For weight, a sample of 464 total patients will be able to detect a difference in slope of 0.175kg/month between the intervention and UC groups with 90% power, two-sided alpha =2.5%, a 0.85 ICC and 2 repeated measures, while assuming 20% attrition at 12 months. For SF-12, a sample of 507 total patients will allow a standardized mean difference (Cohen's d) of 0.35 between the intervention and UC groups with power 90%, two-sided alpha =2.5%, while assuming 20% attrition at 12 months. To power our primary aim, we will enroll 500 veterans. We will conduct a budget impact analysis to establish a business case for future implementation if the intervention is successful. Findings: None to date. Impact: The trial has potential to provide the evidence needed for deciding whether a low-cost, low-technology, self-directed program can be used to expand the treatment of obesity to a population-based level by improving access to obesity treatment regardless of veteran place of residence.",1,1,1,,,,,,self-led lifestyle intervention,1
20181090,Mechanistic machine learning,"The goal of this project is to combine empirical data with mechanistic physiologic knowledge to produce personalized, quantitative predictions that can lead to improved treatments. In normal practice, physicians reason by analogy from generic physiologic principles, but the technology exists to exploit even imperfect physiologic models to make treatment personalized and quantitatively grounded in physiology, and to improve learning from empirical data. We will apply data assimilation (DA), mechanistic mathematical modeling, machine learning, and control theory, which have revolutionized space travel, weather forecasting, transportation and flight, and manufacturing. Data assimilation and control theory have seen very limited use in medicine, usually applied in data-rich circumstances like continuous glucose monitoring or pacemakers. Our previous work demonstrated use of data assimilation with glucose-insulin models to predict glucose in the outpatient type 2 diabetes setting. We will extend data assimilation and control theory using, for example, a constrained ensemble Kalman filter and an offline Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm, to better handle sparse, short training sets on rapidly changing patients, and we will apply it in the setting of glucose management in the intensive care unit (ICU). Moreover, we will develop DA for phenotyping applications by exploiting the parameter estimation capabilities of DA. Data assimilation can be used to estimate measurable and unmeasurable physiologic states and parameters, and we will use these estimates to create higher definition phenotypes. While we are focusing on glucose management in the ICU, we will develop methods that are likely to generalize, beginning the effort to develop DA in the context of health care more broadly. The work we propose is a necessary step toward being able to use mechanism-driven DA to test, validate, and optimize personalized short-term treatment strategies, long-term health forecasts, and mechanistic physiologic understanding. We will carry out the following aims: (aim 1) forecast--extend the DA methodology to allow forecasting, personalization, model evaluation, and model selection in the ICU context, relating treatment input to physiologic outcome; (aim 2) phenotype--extend the DA framework to state and parameter estimation to allow for mechanism-based phenotyping, careful uncertainty quantification, and inference of difficult or impossible-to-measure physiology; (aim 3) control--extend the DA to include a controller that begins with desired clinical outcomes, e.g., glucose range, and estimates the inputs, e.g., insulin or nutrition, required to achieve the outcomes.",1,,,,,,1,,machine learning,1
20181199,CVD risk and outcome heterogeneity in older adults with diabetes,"The overall goal of the proposed research is to provide evidence for individualizing care for older adults with prediabetes (PD) and diabetes (DM) by investigating their risks and development of CVD and disability. Older adults with PD and DM suffer disproportionality from diabetes morbidity, particularly CVD and also disability, an outcome that really matters to patients. Our study will use longitudinal data to observe CVD and disability development in PD/DM patients over time. These analyses will lead to practical population-based methods to stratify people with DM for their individual risks of CVD and disability, helping to individualize care. Our research will test whether CVD and disability development in PD/DM follows several distinct trajectories with different predictors and risks that will differ by age. We hypothesize that CVD explains the risk of disability more in people with PD/DM < 75 than in those older, and that we can develop risk models to better guide clinical decision making. The specific aims are to 1), investigate heterogeneity in the risk of developing CVD in adults from middle to old age aging with PD/DM; 2) investigate heterogeneity in their risk of developing disability; and 3) specify risk models for CVD and disability in people aging with PD/DM, including people with diverse ethnicities and the oldest old. To accomplish our goal, we will perform secondary data analysis of the Health and Retirement Survey (HRS), a nationally representative health interview survey that has been collecting data for over 20 years. Besides extensive health interview information, the HRS also features biomarkers (HbA1c, total and HDL cholesterol, CRP, cystatin), physical assessment information (blood pressure, weight, waist circumference, walking speed), prescription medications for a subsample of participants, and Medicare claims linkages. The HRS allows us to evaluate key variables longitudinally, to account for ethnicity and cohort changes in people aging with PD/DM, and to consider management and its changes over many years. The HRS has enrolled nearly 6,000 people with diabetes aged 51 to over 100. We will employ sophisticated statistical analyses as important tools to test our ideas about dynamic processes, time-dependent risks, and age-cohort differences. We believe this work will provide evidence to guide individualized DM care for older patients and will lead to risk models for outcomes that include people of advanced age, diverse ethnicities, and complex health status.",1,1,,,,,,,"CVD, disability, and diabetes links",1
20181395,EHR nudges: development and testing of a behavioral economics electronic health record module,"This study aims to leverage the power of behavioral economics with electronic health record technology to promote appropriate diabetes care for older adults. Despite a variety of efforts, inappropriate care persists. The ABIM Foundation's Choosing Wisely Campaign identifies focus areas for improvement; one of ten Choosing Wisely initiatives chosen by the American Geriatrics Society promotes less aggressive glycemic targets and limited pharmacologic therapy for older adults with diabetes. Changing provider behavior, however, is challenging, and existing information-based approaches fall short. Novel concepts from behavioral economics, a field that blends insights from economics and psychology to recognize that humans make predictable decision errors, have shown promise in a variety of health care settings. Incorporating such approaches within the electronic health record (EHR) will allow seamless integration into clinical workflow with minimal additional cognitive burden, and provide a mechanism for widespread scaling of effective interventions. We propose to develop a behavioral economics-based EHR module to promote appropriate clinical care of older adults with diabetes. Specific aims include 1) to develop a scalable, EHR customization toolkit that leverages behavioral economic insights (the BE-EHR module) to promote appropriate diabetes care in older adults based on the American Geriatric Society's Choosing Wisely guideline. We will implement a user-centered design process to incorporate behavioral economic approaches into existing clinical decision support tools and clinical workflows to design, iteratively refine, and usability test the new module; 2) to pilot test the new BE-EHR module's feasibility and acceptability and generate preliminary estimates of clinician compliance with the Choosing Wisely guideline. We will conduct a 6-month, single-arm pilot study of the BE-EHR module in 4 outpatient primary care and/or geriatrics clinics to measure utilization and feasibility, and to estimate its impact on appropriate care delivery; and 3) to test the ability of the BE-EHR module to reduce inappropriate diabetes treatment among older adults. We will conduct an 18-month, rigorous, pragmatic, cluster-randomized, controlled trial in 70 sites within the NYU Langone Medical Center ambulatory network to determine the BE-EHR module's impact on appropriate diabetes care among older adults. This proposal combines a unique, experienced multidisciplinary team with a ground-breaking approach to improve the care of older Americans with diabetes.",1,,,1,,,,,nudges for physicians,1
20182066,Component A: A multi-level study of community context and type 2 diabetes and coronary heart disease using electronic health record and new primary data across nested geographies in Pennsylvania,"Type 2 diabetes is the sixth-leading cause of death in the U.S., largely as a result of cardiometabolic complications such as coronary heart disease (CHD). T2D ranges in prevalence from under 4% to almost 18% in counties across the country. The geographic variation can be explained in part by several place-level contextual factors, but the proportion of variance explained by county-level indicators differs regionally. For example, while a combination of nine county-level measures of mainly socioeconomic, race/ethnicity, and built environmental features explain up to 94% of the variation in T2D prevalence in the Midwest, these same factors explain very little variation in Mid-Atlantic counties, including those in Pennsylvania (PA). Our study focuses on four contextual domains that we hypothesize impact T2D and CHD outcomes in PA: chronic environmental contamination, social environment, food environment, and physical activity environment (both utilitarian [walkability] and recreational physical activity). We will evaluate multiple mechanisms through which these factors could impact T2D and CHD. Potential pathways include the influence of physical and social environmental contextual factors on stress, sleep quality, mental health, health care system effectiveness, and obesity-related behaviors. Multilevel studies using nested geographies at several scales are necessary to disentangle the role of contextual and individual factors associated with T2D and its consequences. Thus, we will conduct two nested multilevel studies of T2D and CHD onset and control of T2D. The setting for each is the large, diverse region of PA served by the Geisinger Health System, allowing us to link contextual factors to the wealth of individual-level data contained in electronic health records (EHR). Each will evaluate contextual main effects and then mediation and moderation of these effects. The two connected studies represent an efficient, big data approach to research while simultaneously offering a deep contextual examination of T2D and CHD. The first (38-county EHR study [38co-EHR]) will use existing data on 30,000 patients with T2D and 200,000 patients without T2D. This longitudinal study will be conducted in 38 counties comparing associations in counties and smaller, nested geographies (multi-scale) in relation to T2D onset and control and CHD onset. The second (4-county Behavior and Biomarker Study [4co-BBS]) will study T2D control in four of these counties with high and low T2D burden, evaluating cross-sectional associations in smaller geographies. 4co-BBS will supplement EHR measures and secondary contextual data with primary data collection using saliva cortisol, direct observation of communities, and patient questionnaires. The 4co-BBS study will broaden the scope of pathways examined, collecting data on health behaviors, health system distrust, and community perceptions. Identifying the contextual factors with the greatest influence on the prevalence of T2D and T2D cardiometabolic complications in PA is critical to understanding regional differences and will inform the development of targeted primary and secondary prevention strategies.",1,1,,,1,,,,county level contextual data plus individual level data,1
20182068,Component A: Impact of community factors on geographic disparities in diabetes and obesity nationwide,"Diabetes prevalence has more than doubled in the past two decades, and now nearly 1 in 10 Americans has diabetes. After a similar steep increase, obesity rates among US adults have been stable in the past 10 years, but strong disparities persist and rates are still rising in some groups. Prevention efforts to date have mostly focused on individual-level risk factors. However, a growing body of research has linked diabetes, obesity, and other cardiometabolic risk factors to a range of community characteristics, suggesting that environmental factors can have a direct beneficial or deleterious influence on disease risk. Numerous studies have observed significant and plausible associations between diabetes and obesity prevalence and attributes of the social and physical environment. Some of these community factors are amenable to intervention, yet the true magnitude of their relative contributions remains unclear, especially after adjusting for population characteristics. In response to FOA-DP-17-001, we aim to collaborate with other funded centers to examine modifiable community characteristics that may together explain stark disparities in diabetes, obesity, and other cardiometabolic conditions in the United States using ecologic and multi-level study designs. Specifically, we aim to use county-level prevalence data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) and individual-level electronic medical record data from a very large national Veterans Administration (VA) cohort (~4.6 million patients) to examine the relationship between key community factors pertaining to the food and housing environment and 3 outcomes: diabetes, obesity, and discordance between county-level diabetes and obesity prevalence, an approach that allows us to examine unique contextual risk factors for each condition. Expanding on prior work, we propose developing novel community measures that may contribute to diabetes and obesity disparities. Our primary food environment measures to be refined, shared with other centers, and analyzed pertain to relative ""food swamp"" measures (neighborhoods in which cheap, energy-dense, and pre-prepared food is a dominant option). Our primary housing environment measures to be refined, shared, and analyzed are ""housing cost burden"" measures. We will use causal inference techniques to strengthen our multilevel analyses (e.g., instrumental variable analysis and negative control outcomes). We will also perform causal mediation analysis and primary data collection to examine potential mechanistic pathways on our main study datasets. Primary data will be collected through a planned social determinant of health survey in partnership with the New York City Health Department. Capitalizing on (1) the breadth of expertise among New York University researchers in the areas of health surveillance, food and housing policy research, and causal inquiry methods; (2) access to a very large cohort of VA patients; and (3) our demonstrated track record of leadership and collaboration in other CDC-funded networks, this study offers a powerful opportunity to identify community disease determinants for use in policy and systems change to reduce disparities.",1,,,,1,,,,community factors - food swamps,1
20182073,Prioritizing county-level social determinants that contribute to the greater burden of diabetes and hypertension in the US,"Deaths from cardiovascular disease (CVD) have begun to increase in the US after decades of decline. Although the reasons underlying this increase in CVD deaths are unclear, the prevention, detection, and optimal treatment of CVD risk factors (i.e., diabetes and hypertension) will be essential for preventing any further increases in CVD mortality. Currently, 14% of adults in the US have diabetes, of which 1 in 3 is undiagnosed, and 29% of adults have hypertension. However, stark disparities exist in the CVD risk factor burden, particularly by social determinants of health. These determinants are key contributors to the development of diabetes and hypertension. Yet, they have largely been omitted from clinical practice and decision making. There is increasing awareness of the influence of social determinants on health outcomes, but it is not clear exactly which factors should be assessed or how to integrate this information into current practice. Social determinants of health are extensive, so it is important to characterize those that are likely to have the greatest influence on the prevention, treatment, and control of diabetes and hypertension and may be used to inform the development of targeted programs and policies. We propose to investigate the community and individual social determinants that contribute to a greater burden of diabetes and hypertension in the southeastern US by leveraging national databases, the Medicare claims administrative database and the infrastructure of a prospective cohort study, the NIH-funded Reasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) study, that enrolled 30,239 middle-aged and older adults in 2003-07. We will build upon these resources to address the following aims: 1) determine the association of county-level social determinants of health with the county-level prevalence and incidence of diabetes and hypertension, separately, in the southeastern US; 2) evaluate the association of county-level social determinants of health with the county-level prevalence and incidence of diabetes and hypertension, separately, among older adults in the southeastern US using the Medicare database; and 3) evaluate the association of county-level and individual-level social determinants of health with individual-level prevalent and incident diabetes and hypertension, separately, among REGARDS participants in the southeastern US. This proposal will prioritize those social determinants of health that are associated with a greater burden of diabetes and hypertension in the southeastern US and help guide prevention programs and interventions to reduce this excess risk.",1,1,,,1,,,,county level social determinants and individual level social determinants,1
20182075,Validation of survey questions to distinguish type 1 and type 2 diabetes among adults with diabetes,"Type 1 and type 2 diabetes are distinct clinical conditions with different etiologies, ages of onset, management strategies, risk factors, and outcomes. Currently, the data sources that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) relies upon to monitor trends in diabetes prevalence and incidence are unable to reliably distinguish between types of diabetes. Most of the large federal surveys used for diabetes surveillance have not included questions on diabetes type, and few studies have reported survey-based algorithms for identifying diabetes type. None have compared survey-based identification algorithms with a gold standard case ascertainment in order to validate survey-based assignment of diabetes type. Methods for distinguishing between diabetes types in electronic health records (EHR) data have been tested for children and adults, but additional validation work is needed. Our approach to improving diabetes surveillance in these two areas is based on an integrated study design whereby survey data for diabetes patients are linked with data from their EHR and a gold standard case ascertainment derived from chart review. We will select a diverse sample of diabetes patients that is designed and powered to assess algorithm validity for subpopulations defined by age, sex, and race/ethnicity. We will use rigorous questionnaire development methods to build on items used in previous surveys, cognitively test the new survey module to optimize wording and question order, field the survey using data collection methods similar to established CDC surveys, and analyze the responses relative to a gold standard classification of diabetes type. In addition, we will develop and validate against the gold standard EHR-based algorithms, including a modeling approach that produces a parsimonious rule-based algorithm for determining diabetes type based on the most important clinical variables, and a machine learning approach that uses the gold standard dataset as a starting point to identify implicit patterns that distinguish T1DM and T2DM.",1,,,,,,1,,improving surveillance systems,1
20182091,Improving diabetes and depression self-management via adaptive mobile messaging,"Diabetes and depression are major public health problems that disproportionately affect racial/ethnic minorities and low-income individuals in the US. Efficacious interventions for depression and diabetes exist but are not often combined despite similar treatment recommendations (specifically physical activity) for both conditions. Especially in resource-constrained environments, mobile health (mHealth) technologies are cost-effective and feasible methods for delivering self-management support, given the more ubiquitous penetration across socioeconomic status. Existing mHealth interventions have shown preliminary success but have had difficulty sustaining engagement. When combined with machine learning algorithms, health messages can be adapted to specifically motivate individuals based on their unique profiles. In aim 1, we will integrate content from interventions targeting diabetes, depression, and physical activity, applying user design methods. We will utilize the existing Healthy SMS platform as the basis for this intervention. This will be called the Diabetes and Mental Health Adaptive Notification Tracking and Evaluation (DIAMANTE) study. In aim 2, we will test an mHealth intervention for diabetes and depression that will generate messages using an adaptive machine learning algorithm that learns from patient step count data (collected passively via a smartphone app) and patient-entered blood glucose and mood ratings. We will compare this adaptive, personalized intervention with a static messaging intervention, typical of many existing text messaging interventions. In aim 3, we will rerandomize non-responsive participants to receiving nurse outreach using a sequential, multiple assignment, randomized trial (SMART) design. We will leverage the SMART design to conserve more expensive one-on-one nurse outreach for the patients who are no longer engaged in the program and need the most support. We will test this intervention with 350 patients from a safety net setting in English and Spanish. The primary outcomes for this study are HbA1c levels and PHQ-9 scores. The results of this study will help us understand the impact of personalizing content utilizing machine learning algorithms as well as the impact of providing clinician support for those receiving mobile health interventions.

20182184,"Healthy Bodies, Healthy Souls","Research indicates that Marshallese (a Pacific Islander population from the Republic of the Marshall Islands) suffer from a significant and disproportionate burden of type 2 diabetes with rates ranging from 24% to 50%. This is ~400% higher than the general population. Researchers have noted inadequacies in existing interventions to address the health disparities related to diabetes in Marshallese and other Pacific Islander groups. Current interventions are limited in two ways: 1) interventions are not culturally relevant and 2) the interventions focus primarily on individual-level motivations that are not likely to be persuasive within the highly collectivistic Pacific Islander cultures. Our overall goal is to adapt, test, and disseminate an intervention that is effective at reducing the risk and impact of diabetes among Pacific Islander communities. This application uses a CBPR approach to culturally adapt, implement, and test the Healthy Bodies, Health Souls intervention in Marshallese churches. Healthy Bodies, Healthy Souls is a faith-based intervention originally developed for implementation in African American churches. Healthy Bodies, Healthy Souls uses a multilevel approach to primary and secondary diabetes prevention. The proposed research builds upon four years of CBPR with Marshallese living in northwest Arkansas. In phase one of the project, a transdisciplinary CBPR team of university researchers, community co-investigators and the broader Marshallese community will culturally adapt Healthy Bodies, Healthy Souls. The 22-week program addresses diabetes risk at multiple levels by focusing on individual, social, and organizational factors associated with sustained improvements in diet and physical activity. The team will use Bernal's eight dimensions of cultural sensitivity to guide the adaptation process. In phase two, we will implement and test the culturally adapted program in Marshallese churches. The study will use a mixed-methods approach to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and effectiveness of the adapted intervention. We have two specific aims: (aim 1) culturally adapt the Healthy Bodies, Healthy Souls intervention for delivery in Marshallese churches using a community-engaged approach and Bernal's cultural adaptation framework; and (aim 2) implement and test the culturally adapted intervention in Marshallese churches using methods of community-engaged research and a mixed-methods approach to assess the program's feasibility, acceptability, and effectiveness. The study's findings will add to a very limited scientific knowledge base that informs work with Marshallese and other Pacific Islander communities. The study will generate pilot data to inform other areas with limited research, including engaged research with communities that have a history of trauma, faith-based approaches to diabetes prevention, community-engaged cultural adaptation, and multilevel approaches to diabetes prevention.

20183051,Clinical and health care use outcomes for vertical sleeve gastrectomy vs. Roux-en-Y gastric bypass using a national commercial insurance claims dataset,"Over 15 million Americans now have severe obesity, i.e. a body-mass index (BMI) >=35 kg/m2. Patients with severe obesity have 5-times higher prevalence of type 2 diabetes, and twice the annual medical costs of those with normal body weights. Bariatric surgery is the most effective treatment for severe obesity, but is invasive, costly, and associated with short- and longer-term complications. The vertical sleeve gastrectomy (VSG) is a newer bariatric procedure that has substantially increased in use recently, now accounting for approximately half of procedures worldwide. However, very little is known about longer-term outcomes after VSG, including the durability of its impact on diabetes, and its potential for reducing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Of particular importance for patients considering surgery, the risks and benefits of VSG compared to the ""gold standard"" gastric bypass (RYGB) procedure are not well understood. The proposed study will use a nationwide commercial insurance claims dataset to evaluate clinical and health care use outcomes among over 10,000 patients undergoing VSG, compared to 10,000 patients undergoing RYGB, between 2005 and 2017, with up to 8 years of post-operative follow-up. Rigorous observational study designs with propensity score matching will be used to compare the effect of VSG and RYGB on clinical outcomes, including diabetes remission and relapse, myocardial infarction, stroke, and death; health care use outcomes, including emergency department visits, hospital days, and reoperation or revisional surgery; and health care costs, including standardized total, prescription, and out-of-pocket costs. Furthermore, to assist with procedure selection, exploratory analyses will investigate the optimal surgical type for patients with certain key characteristics (e.g., by age group, diabetes severity). To minimize risk of confounding by indication, cutting-edge propensity score matching algorithms will be employed and rigorous longitudinal designs such as interrupted time series and survival analysis will be constructed. This will be the largest claims-based comparative study of these two procedures, with potential to significantly impact clinical practice in bariatric surgery. Findings could inform more evidence-based practice and facilitate shared clinical decision making by improving the ability of patients and surgeons to select a surgical approach that is optimized to patients' preferred health outcomes and personal characteristics.",1,1,,,,,,,vertical sleeve gastrectomy,1
20183063,Impact of augmented care at the worksite for diabetes prevention,"In the U.S., approximately 40% of the population has some hyperglycemic condition. Worksite interventions offer a promising framework for delivering public health interventions to people with prediabetes, since worksites reach a large segment of the population for most of their adult life. The opportunity for long-term follow-up and support may be greater through worksites than through clinic-based programs. Worksite interventions that promote weight loss through lifestyle modification reduce risk for type 2 diabetes among those at high risk. However, there is heterogeneity in the weight loss response following a standard lifestyle intervention, and early non-response to treatment is an indicator of treatment success. Stepped, or augmented, care can be effective in promoting additional weight loss among early non-responders. Furthermore, effective treatments for weight loss maintenance, especially at the worksite, are not well known. Ongoing contact and support, frequent self-weighing, and skill building in problem solving and barrier reduction offer promise as intervention strategies for weight loss maintenance. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to evaluate the impact of the standard 16-week, goal-based Group Lifestyle Balance (GLB) intervention for diabetes prevention to an alternate version of the intervention (GLB+) that is restructured with training in cognitive and emotional agency for change, problem solving, and goal attainment. University employees who are at least 21 years old with prediabetes (n=236) will be recruited and receive the first 4 weeks of the standard GLB intervention. Participants who fail to achieve 2.5% weight loss at intervention week 5 will receive the GLB+ intervention for the remaining 12 weeks. The 16-week core intervention phase then will be followed by an 8-month extended intervention phase to promote weight loss maintenance. Following the core intervention phase, matched pairs of participants will be created based on gender and percent weight change from baseline. Each person in the pair will be randomly assigned to either the extended intervention phase of the standard GLB intervention or to the extended intervention phase of the GLB+ intervention. A 6-month no-contact maintenance phase will follow the extended intervention phase. The impact of the interventions on percent change in weight (primary outcome), fasting glucose, lipid panel, blood pressure, dietary intake, physical activity, quality of life, and constructs related to problem solving and goal setting will be determined at 4, 12, and 18 months. Cost-effectiveness analysis also will be conducted to determine if the benefits associated with weight change justify the costs associated with intervention augmentation. The proposed study will enable evaluation of a practical approach for a sustainable diabetes prevention program at a university worksite and the impact of augmented care on early non-response to treatment and on weight loss maintenance.",1,,1,,,,,,group lifestyle balance intervention implemented at the worksite. ,1
20183128,Reducing risk factors for type 2 diabetes in American Indian youth: Tribal Turning Point (TTP),"American Indian (Native) youth have the highest incidence and prevalence of pediatric type 2 diabetes of all racial/ethnic groups in the United States. Lifestyle modification has been shown to prevent type 2 diabetes among high-risk adults by up to 58%, including among Native populations, but similar efforts in Native youth have been largely unsuccessful. We recently developed a behavioral intervention for Native youth-parent dyads called Tribal Turning Point (TTP). In a randomized pilot study, we demonstrated feasibility of program delivery, acceptability by Native stakeholders, and significant treatment effects for multiple obesity measures. We now propose to conduct a randomized controlled trial to rigorously evaluate the effect of TTP on diabetes risk factors in 300 overweight/obese Native youth aged 7-10 years who are living in urban or rural communities served by the Indian Health Services. Within each community, youth will be randomized to the TTP program or a general health and safety control program. The multi-component TTP intervention is a youth-centered adaptation of the Diabetes Prevention Program designed to reduce diabetes risk factors by improving activity and dietary behaviors. The 12-month intervention includes 12 active learning group classes, 7 individual youth/parent motivational interviewing counseling sessions, and community-specific resource toolboxes. In this trial, we will assess the effect of TTP on anthropometric, metabolic, and behavioral risk factors for type 2 diabetes at the end of the intervention (12 months) and after 1 year of follow-up (24 months). With an eye toward widespread dissemination of the program, we will also collect qualitative data on factors related to participant engagement, program delivery, and potential for sustainability throughout the award period, which will guide future implementation efforts. The specific aims of our proposal are 1) evaluate the effect of TTP on anthropometric (primary: BMI; secondary: BMI z-score, waist circumference) and metabolic (primary: fasting insulin; secondary: hemoglobin A1c) diabetes risk factors at 12 and 24 months; 2) examine the effect of TTP on health behaviors (diet, physical activity) and the extent to which improvements in health behaviors mediate the effects of TTP on diabetes risk factors; and 3) explore individual, organizational, and community-level factors related to participant engagement, program implementation, and potential for sustained delivery.",1,1,1,,,,,,AIAN youth + group interventoin,1
20182168,Factors associated with reducing diabetes-related disparities of rural Latinos,"We propose a research study that would greatly expand the opportunity for students to be involved in research, contribute to their knowledge about the health care service needs of rural populations, and stimulate research at our university about health care for minority ethnic/racial rural populations, especially rural Latinos. The proposed study addresses the problem of health disparities among rural populations as a whole, and among rural Latino residents specifically. The U.S. Latino population is growing at a rapid pace. As a group, they are at a high risk for developing diabetes. Compared to other groups, they have high percentages of overweight or obesity, which are among the risk factors associated with type 2 diabetes (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2014). The complications of diabetes are serious and costly to the patient and the health care system as a whole. To date, little is known about the potential impact of accountable care organizations (ACOs) on ethnic/racial disparities in health care (Pollack & Armstrong, 2011). Knowing how ACOs affect these disparities is particularly essential because some minority groups, such as Latinos, African Americans, and Native Americans, are more concentrated in rural areas (Institute of Medicine, 2005). We propose a longitudinal study, the purpose of which is to 1) compare health disparities and patient outcomes of rural Latino older adult patients diagnosed with diabetes to their non-Latino white counterparts and 2) ascertain the impact of ACO participation by rural primary care providers (along with other factors) on rural Latino older adult patients. The study has two goals: (aim 1) to measure the disparities in diabetes-related hospitalization rates between rural Latino older adult patients of Medicare ACOs and rural non-Latino white older adult patients; and (aim 2) to identify factors related to reduced disparities in diabetes-related hospitalization rates of rural Latino older adult patients, including RHC participation in a Medicare ACO. We will apply a pre-post design treating Medicare ACO participation as an intervention. The project will use data for a four-year period before the Medicare ACOs began (2008-2011) and a four-year period afterwards (2012-2015). The project will proceed in 3 major phases as follows: 1) collecting, merging, and organizing secondary data from multiple sources; 2) researching and constructing variables to include in the analyses; and 3) conducting univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analyses. The study will contribute to rural health research by adding to the knowledge about 1) the factors that contribute to minimizing diabetes-related health disparities of rural Latino adults, 2) the diabetes preventive care effectiveness of ACOs, and 3) the types of ACOs most beneficial to rural Latino patients.",1,1,,1,,,,,disparities in utilization among Hispanic ,1
20183044,Community to Clinic Navigation to improve diabetes outcomes,"Reducing adverse outcomes from type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) requires optimal self-management and appropriate clinical care. Combining an evidence-based intervention to improve diabetes self-management with individually tailored patient navigation to improve appropriate clinical care holds great promise. Only one known randomized controlled trial has been tested that combines these two most essential components of diabetes control. That trial resulted in improvements to glycemic control, blood pressure, and diabetes self-management, but was implemented in a clinical setting. We aim to enhance this work by recruiting from and locating most research activities in community-based settings to ensure involvement of the most vulnerable, hardest to reach populations who may not be receiving regular health care and by leveraging community health workers and patient navigators, who are essential and sustainable outreach workers in health care professional shortage areas. We propose testing a refined intervention, ""Community to Clinic Navigation"" (CCN), shown to be promising, feasible, and acceptable in our pilot study. Given that Appalachian and rural residents maintain disproportionately high rates of T2DM and suffer tremendous burdens from diabetic complications, this setting provides a perfect opportunity to test the intervention with a hard-to-reach population while addressing health inequities. We will administer a 3-arm group randomized design including (1) Diabetes Self-management Program, DSMP only; (2) tailored Patient Navigation, PN only; and (3) the combined DSMP + PN: Community to Clinic Navigation program, CCN. Outcomes include biometrics (HbA1c, BMI, blood pressure, lipids, waist circumference); diabetes self-management and clinic attendance, as mediators of the primary outcomes; cost-effectiveness; and participant satisfaction. Persons with diabetes will be recruited through churches and other community venues. Our project leverages sustainable assets available in most health disparity communities--faith organizations, community centers, federally qualified health clinics, strong social ties, and talented local lay people who can be trained to educate and navigate those diagnosed with T2DM. Our sustained involvement in Appalachian Kentucky positions our team to appropriately and efficiently test this promising program with strong potential for future dissemination to other traditionally underserved environments.",1,1,1,,,,,,individual intervention plus community based patient navigation,1
20183212,Disease beliefs and cognition: effect on diabetes management in older breast cancer survivors,"The impact of disease beliefs on self-management of chronic illness such as diabetes (DM) in the setting of cancer is largely unknown. In addition, little is known about the impact of age- or cancer-related cognitive changes on cancer survivors' self-management behaviors (SMB) for their other comorbidities. Without this knowledge, our ability to provide optimal self-management support for cancer survivors with comorbidities is limited. The goal of this study is to determine how disease beliefs about cancer and DM and cognitive changes affect older breast cancer survivors' DM SMB. We will focus on older breast cancer survivors with early stage cancer who have received chemotherapy or hormonal therapy (HT) since these patients are more likely to have age- or cancer-related cognitive changes and are more likely to die from complications from their comorbidities as from their breast cancer. We will focus on DM due to its high prevalence in cancer survivors, association with worse cancer outcomes and cognitive decline, impact on competing risks of death, and its moderate SMB complexity. The study design is rooted in the common sense self-regulation model (CSM), a theory of health behaviors that has been used to develop interventions, but has primarily been applied to research on behaviors around single diseases. By understanding the relationship between disease beliefs about breast cancer and DM and the interrelationship of disease beliefs and cognitive function on survivors' DM SMB, we will advance both the CSM and care of older breast cancer survivors with comorbidities. The specific aims are to 1) evaluate the longitudinal interrelationship of beliefs about breast cancer and DM and its effect on survivors' DM SMB (adherence to medications, diet, and exercise); 2) assess the effect of cognitive function on DM SMB and evaluate whether disease beliefs mediate, in part, an association between cognition and DM SMB; and 3) develop and pilot an educational and counseling intervention to improve DM SMB among breast cancer survivors with comorbid DM. This prospective cohort study will recruit 320 older (>=55years) breast cancer survivors with pre-existing DM who have completed first-line chemotherapy or are taking hormonal therapy for treatment of early stage (I-IIIA) breast cancer within the past 5 years. We will first conduct qualitative interviews with 20 survivors to identify DM and cancer health beliefs and to elicit specific strategies and routines used to manage DM. We will then recruit 300 participants and interview them every 6 months for 24 months to assess longitudinal changes in cancer and DM beliefs and in cognition to evaluate their impact on DM SMB. For the subgroup of women currently taking HT, we will also assess the impact of beliefs and cognitive function on HT adherence. We will integrate the information collected in the quantitative and qualitative interviews to create educational and counseling modules and pilot test their impact on SMB on a group of 100 breast cancer survivors with DM. The proposed study addresses the need to develop strategies to optimize SMB for chronic comorbidities in cancer survivors using breast cancer and DM as the paradigm.",1,1,,,,,,,breast cancer patients and self management of diabetes,1
20183235,Community-based diabetes and hypertension self-management program in West Virginia,"West Virginians have one of the highest prevalence of comorbid diabetes and hypertension in the United States, which poses an enormous disease and economic burden in this medically underserved state. Self-management of these conditions is an essential component of comprehensive disease management. The majority of self-management programs in West Virginia are clinic- or hospital-based, disease-specific, short-term, and provide limited participant interactions. The proposed study aims to fill this need by implementing a new and creative community-based, culturally appropriate, and cost-effective diabetes and hypertension self-management program (DHSMP) among adults with comorbid diabetes and hypertension. The DHSMP is adapted from the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) and AADE-7 self-care behaviors, and tailored for rural and socioeconomically disadvantaged populations, using the community-based participatory approach. The DHSMP will be administered by trained health coaches and will involve communication between them and the participants to provide continuous feedback and reinforcement of self-management strategies and health education messages. We will use a randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing the 12-week DHSMP to an enhanced usual care (EUC) control group and conduct rigorous cost-effectiveness analyses. The DHSMP builds on the PI's successful prior community-based lifestyle intervention studies in rural Appalachia and rural India. Seventy adults with comorbid type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension will be recruited and randomized to 12-week DHSMP intervention (n=35) or an EUC control group (n=35) in two geographically separated Appalachian communities in WV. EUC participants will be waitlisted to receive DHSMP after 3 months. Specific aims will test the hypotheses that the participants randomized to receive the 12-week DHSMP will have significantly greater improvements in self-efficacy, and reductions in HbA1c and blood pressure as well as reduction in weight, and improvements in diet, physical activity, health-related quality of life, and social support at 3 and 6 months as compared to the EUC control group. We anticipate that the DHSMP will be cost-effective. Data on demographic, lifestyle factors, costs, anthropometric measures, and clinical indicators will be collected during baseline and post intervention periods (3 and 6 months). The results will inform the development and translation of large-scale community interventions to promote self-management of co-morbid chronic conditions in this medically underserved and rural Appalachian population.",1,,1,,,,,,community based intervention in rural WV,1
20174104,Integrating contextual factors into clinical decision support to reduce contextual error and improve outcomes in ambulatory care,"A patient contextual factor refers to a patient circumstance or behavior that is essential to address when planning effective care. For instance, a patient's inability to pay for costly medication is a contextual factor when presenting with poor medication adherence, particularly when a less costly alternative is available. Inattention to contextual factors results in contextual errors when care plans are inappropriate because of inattention to patient context. Contextual errors are associated with diminished health care outcomes and with overuse and misuse of medical services. Contextual errors and their adverse consequences may be averted if physicians are provided and prompted to use contextual information at the point of care. The aim of the proposed research, submitted in response to Special Emphasis Notice (SEN) NOT-HS-16-015, is to assess the potential of clinical decision support (CDS) enhanced with patient contextual information to reduce contextual error rates, improve health care outcomes, and reduce unnecessary care. The first phase of the study consists of designing and introducing a passive and active CDS intervention informed by contextual information provided by patients through a web portal as well from the electronic medical record, in two widely employed EMRs, Cerner and Epic. In the second phase, patients will be randomized to receive care either with or without enhanced contextualized CDS. To assess the efficacy of the intervention on physician behavior during the encounter, participating patients will audio record their visits, and the data will be audio and EMR coded using the validated contextual error tracking system, Content Coding for Contextual Error, or ""4C."" 4C tags each contextual factor and classifies the encounter as contextualized when contextual factors are addressed, and as containing a contextual error when not addressed. Four to six months following the index visit a structured chart review will assess outcomes as defined by response to the clinical presentation at the index visit. For instance, resolution of an elevated HgB A1c in a patient whose care was informed by contextualized CDS indicating that the patient required pre-filled syringes because of difficulty dosing their insulin, would constitute a favorable response. In addition, unannounced standardized patients (USPs), who are actors trained to portray standardized scripts customized to assess response to the intervention, will present with cases containing complicating contextual factors that if overlooked result in overuse and misuse of medical services, to assess the impact of the intervention on reducing unnecessary care. This study, which will recruit 480 patients and engage 20 USPs in 80 visits, has sufficient power to detect clinically meaningful reductions in contextual error rates, improvement in health care outcomes, and cost reductions following the introduction of contextualized CDS.",1,,,1,,,,,clinical decision support systems,1
20174188,Artificially intelligent diabetes assistant (AIDA) for African Americans with type 2 diabetes,"Diabetes, a chronic disease associated with significant morbidity and mortality, is disproportionately represented in African Americans. Diabetes self-management education and support (DSME/S) is crucial to delaying or preventing disease progression; however, lack of access to proper health care due to financial, cultural, knowledge, geographic, or physical barriers places this disadvantaged population at further risk for poor disease outcomes. Mobile health (mHealth) technologies have shown promise in improving health outcomes, but have important limitations for management of this complex disease. For example, they can lack personalization to users' cultural, health, and educational needs. Some technologies, like apps and wearables, require high self-motivation, health literacy, and knowledge for successful utilization. Moreover, most technological solutions do not support the patient-provider collaboration critical to sustained behavioral change and ongoing diabetes care over a lifetime. We propose to build an artificially intelligent diabetes assistant (AIDA), a chatbot-powered telehealth platform that is designed to provide highly interactive, automated diabetes self-care support and facilitate remote patient-provider collaboration. Through dynamic, instant-messaging based conversations, AIDA will provide interpretive feedback of blood glucose levels, conduct assessments (e.g., medication adherence, mood), and deliver real-time, culturally sensitive interventions using smartphone technology. AI technology will enable increasingly targeted, individualized interventions. Integration into a larger communication platform will allow providers to remotely assess, monitor, and intervene using real-time patient data collected by the chatbot. AIDA will be a low-cost, smart-phone based, ecologically relevant tool that is highly innovative, engaging, and impactful. This research will be conducted in collaboration with urban-based community clinics and University of North Carolina researchers specializing in diabetes, health disparities, African American population, telehealth, and behavioral change interventions. In this phase I SBIR project, we will address the following specific aims: 1) conduct focus groups and interviews with African American diabetes patients, their caregivers, and diabetes care providers to collect input on system features, usability design, and messaging content; 2) develop three AIDA health modules (glucose monitoring, medication adherence, healthy coping) and a virtual health library; and 3) examine the feasibility and acceptability of the new technology. A future phase II application will build on phase I success by creating additional health modules (nutrition, exercise, and risk management) and conducting a clinical trial comparing the efficacy of traditional DSME/S to AIDA support on health and disease outcomes. We envision that AIDA will be marketed to diabetes care providers, with revenue generated through licensing fees. If found effective, AIDA could be deployed across the national network of diabetes providers/programs, potentially improving health equity in diabetes care.",1,1,,,,,,,mobile health modules,1
20183039,"Unveiling the role of physician implicit bias and communication behaviors in dissatisfaction, mistrust, and nonadherence in black patients with type 2 diabetes","Patient-physician racial discordance is strongly associated with patient dissatisfaction and mistrust in physicians, which is further associated with poor treatment adherence and suboptimal health care utilization. This poses serious public health challenges because approximately 80-90% of black patients see physicians from different racial groups. Patient dissatisfaction and mistrust have been recently found to be particularly magnified when physicians hold high levels of automatic, implicit bias toward black Americans, suggesting that physicians' implicit racial bias impacts physician communication behaviors during medical interactions and ultimately black patient outcomes. The overall goal of this research is to identify physicians' communication behaviors during medical interactions that are associated with physicians' implicit racial bias and black patients' immediate outcomes (satisfaction, trust) as well as clinically important longer-term outcomes (adherence, health care utilization). To achieve this goal, we target medical interactions involving black patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) because nonadherence in black patients with T2DM is particularly prevalent. Additionally, the patient-physician communication quality has been found to predict patient adherence to T2DM treatment regimens. We will use a mixed-methods design that integrates the strengths of inductive reasoning to explore which physician communication behaviors during medical interactions matter from black patients' perspectives and deductive reasoning to identify theoretically and clinically important behaviors. Our aims are (aim 1) to explore which physician communication behaviors during medical interactions are perceived negatively or positively by black patients and why; (aim 2) to identify which physician communication behaviors identified in aim 1 are associated with physicians' implicit racial bias; and (aim 3) to examine how physicians' implicit racial bias impacts black patients' satisfaction, trust, adherence, and health care utilization through physicians' communication behaviors. We will use an innovative integration of multiple methods (interviews, video-recorded medical interactions, surveys, medical record reviews). Findings from this research will enable researchers to identify physician communication behaviors during medical interactions that are problematic and beneficial to the immediate and longer-term outcomes among black patients with T2DM. Such an ability is needed to develop personally tailored, targeted communication skills training and other interventions targeting patient-provider interactions to overcome racial disparities in diabetes treatment adherence, outcomes, and beyond. Additionally, upon completion of this project, we will have a Medical Interaction involving Black Patients Coding System (MIBPCS) that differs from prior patient-physician communication coding systems in that it (1) will focus on physicians' communication behaviors during medical interactions that can predict black patients' outcomes and (2) places an unprecedented importance on the patients' point of view.",1,,1,,,,,,physicial-patient interaction,1
20183154,Effectiveness of advanced practice pharmacy services among American Indian and Alaska Native adults with diabetes,"Effectiveness of advanced practice pharmacy services among American Indian and Alaska Native adults with diabetes The Indian Health Service (IHS) funds services for approximately 2.2 million American Indians and Alaska Natives (AI/ANs). IHS health care resources are strained due to limited per capita spending, the disproportionate high costs of treating AI/ANs with diabetes, and provider shortages. All-cause mortality of AI/ANs is 46% higher than that of non-Hispanic whites, attributable in part to higher mortality associated with diabetes. Within IHS, the provision of advanced practice pharmacy (APP) services for adults with diabetes has increased. During fiscal year (FY) 2008, approximately 1% of AI/ANs with diabetes used APP. Just 5 years later, 9.6% (n=4,620) had at least 1 APP visit in FY2013. To date, IHS has not had the institutional capacity to fully characterize the provision of APP services, nor study its effectiveness or costs. Given the need to both improve outcomes for patients with diabetes and effectively utilize limited IHS resources, this study's goal is to describe and assess the effectiveness of emerging models of APP within IHS for treatment of diabetes. Since 2010, IHS and Tribes have collaborated with the Centers for American Indian and Alaska Native Health at the University of Colorado to create a longitudinal data infrastructure with health status, service utilization, and treatment cost data for over 640,000 AI/ANs, who represent nearly 30% of AI/ANs who use IHS services. The infrastructure, created through the Improving Health Care Delivery Data Project, is a synthesis of existing electronic data from multiple IHS platforms and currently includes data for 7 years (FY2007-2013) for 15 project sites. We propose to continue this collaboration by updating the infrastructure with recent data (FY2014-2017) to evaluate APP effectiveness among AI/AN adults with diabetes using statistical techniques made possible by the longitudinal data. The study has 3 aims: (1) characterize APP delivery models for adults with diabetes within sites and over time using site characteristics and patient health risk profiles (e.g., glycemic level [A1c], blood pressure [BP], cholesterol [CHL], cardiovascular disease). We anticipate that up to 3 models may emerge (e.g., targeted, limited, and general); (2) for each APP model, evaluate the nature and extent of the relationship between patient APP use and outcomes. Within each model, we expect that APP will improve medication adherence and A1c, BP, and CHL levels, and reduce onset of complications and preventable hospital stays; and (3) estimate APP delivery costs, treatment cost changes associated with lower use of other health services, and cost-effectiveness. We expect the APP models to be cost-effective.",1,1,,,,,,,use of advanced practice pharmacists among patients with diabetes,1
20174156,Reaching racial/ethnic minority communities to support healthy lifestyle change: virtual world training for community health workers,"The burden of diabetes is greater for racial/ethnic minorities, including African Americans. Overweight and obesity are risk factors for the development of diabetes and are also more prevalent in racial/ethnic minorities. The Diabetes Prevention Program and subsequent translation studies demonstrated the efficacy of a lifestyle intervention on reducing weight and risk of type 2 diabetes. Increasing evidence supports efforts to engage CHWs to help extend our reach to reduce obesity and diabetes risk in underserved communities. Research is needed to identify standard, effective, and scalable CHW training models to equip them to help extend our reach in racial/ethnic minority communities, especially at-risk African Americans. Internet-based immersive 3-dimensional (3-D) virtual world environments offer the opportunity to reach populations with standardized and tailored approaches that can overcome common barriers to participation and allow for engaging and experiential educational opportunities. Building on our prior work and experience, we will tailor/adapt, implement, and evaluate an internet-based 3-D virtual world model to remotely deliver a CHW training program (CDC ""Road to Health"" [RTH]) to support CHWs' efforts to educate at-risk African American communities about lifestyle changes to reduce obesity and diabetes risk. We will use a sequential mixed-methods design to address these specific aims: aim 1) use community-based participatory research methods to guide the overall study and inform tailoring and adaptation of our virtual world model to deliver the CHW training program; aim 2) conduct a randomized pilot study (N=40 CHWs) to compare change in primary outcomes (0, 12 weeks) after the in-person versus virtual world delivery of the training program. Participants will be experienced African American female CHWs who share characteristics of the at-risk population they serve. Primary CHW outcomes include program content knowledge and delivery skill, self-efficacy, adherence, and change in lifestyle behaviors; and aim 3) conduct summative focus groups to refine the CHW virtual world training program and study methodology to guide subsequent development of an R01. If our virtual world CHW training model shows promise in this study and subsequent effectiveness in an RCT, it could be tailored/adapted for diverse groups and scaled for broad remote dissemination.",1,1,1,,,,,,community health worker delivered intervention,1
20181210,Development of a total nutrient index,"Diet is a modifiable exposure that can positively or negatively impact health. More than half of adults and one-third of children use dietary supplements that contain nutrients critical to human health. Currently no metric exists to measure overall total nutrient exposures from all sources. Without measuring the contribution of dietary supplements, exposure classification is incomplete both for nutrient inadequacy and nutrient excess. Using a data-driven strategy with the nationally representative National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), the assembled, highly qualified team proposes to develop the first comprehensive total nutrient index. Indexes and scores are the preferred metric for use in nutrition because the standardized framework they create allows comparison across studies. In fact, the 2015 Dietary Guidelines for Americans Advisory Committee, building on systematic reviews from the USDA Nutrition Evidence Library, concluded that only diets classified by indexes and scores were useful for informing nutrition policy. The synthesis of the data in the report yielded strong and consistent evidence for dietary patterns classified by indexes and scores, and cardiovascular disease and weight status, and moderate evidence for dietary patterns and type 2 diabetes. However, no index or score is available that accounts for nutrients derived from dietary supplements and medications. In aim 1, the team will develop a usual intake model that captures habitual intakes from food, beverages, dietary supplements, and medication, mitigating the measurement error to the extent possible with self-reported dietary intakes. In aim 2, the team will characterize the patterns of nutrient intake, using data reduction techniques to create the most salient items to include in the index. The patterns will be carefully examined with regard to biomarkers, health behaviors, and measures of bone and body composition, to create a scoring algorithm for the total nutrient index. In aim 3, the team will test the reliability and the validity of the total nutrient index. The purpose of the total nutrient index is to provide a tool that can be used for research, monitoring, and policy purposes, and the use of the NHANES data to develop the total nutrient index greatly enhances its external validity. Improving measures of dietary exposure will facilitate researchers' abilities to show causal links to health, ultimately enabling successful intervention strategies.",1,1,,,,,,,developing nutrient index,1
20183151,Does free medicine coverage improve diabetes self-care and outcomes for diverse populations?,"The financial burden of medications is a significant barrier to medication adherence and subsequent diabetes control. Benefit designs that reduce copayments for services that are seen to be more cost-effective (known as ""value-based insurance designs"" or VBIDs) continue to capture the attention of public and private insurers, employers, and policy makers as a strategy to improve adherence and reduce long-term costs. While VBID programs that reduce copayments for chronic illness medications have been shown to have a positive short-term impact on medication adherence, we know less about long-term sustainability of clinical gains over time, particularly when incentives are eliminated. Also, little is known about which factors affect who participates and who benefits when VBID programs are introduced by a health plan in a real-world, multi-employer setting. This study will evaluate the provision and discontinuation of a real-world VBID program called the WellRx DrugRider--a zero copay drug benefit offered to engage patients more effectively in their self-care. To take advantage of this unique natural experiment, we will use a multi-method approach, including patient-mailed surveys; semi-structured interviews of patients, providers, and employers; and a quasi-experimental longitudinal study using pre-post with comparison group and patient-level interrupted time series with comparison series to evaluate the impact of WellRx among patients with diabetes. This study is motivated by four specific aims: (1) to examine determinants of decisions about WellRx participation among employers and patients with diabetes and assess differences in at-risk patient subgroups (e.g., race and socioeconomic status); (2) to examine changes in self-management, utilization and costs, and clinical outcomes (HbA1c, lipid, blood pressure control) over a 1-year baseline and up to 4-year follow-up, comparing patients whose employers offered the free program compared to propensity-matched patients whose employers did not; (3) to assess sustainability of outcomes following program discontinuation, comparing patients whose employers continue or choose to discontinue WellRx coverage in later follow-up years; and (4) to determine whether the changes observed in aims 2 and 3 differ by race/ethnicity, income, education attainment, or baseline nonadherence. The proposed study addresses pragmatic questions in a real-world health system that is highly motivated to improve access to care, self-efficacy, and outcomes for a diverse population of patients with diabetes. Our findings will inform future efforts to create benefit designs that are provider-endorsed, align with patient needs, address barriers to patient engagement, and improve patient capacity to maintain effective diabetes control.",1,,,,,1,,,zero copay benefit design evaluation,1
20173023,Toward optimizing diabetes care in persons with chronic kidney disease,"The purpose of this K01 proposal is to provide Dr. Jinnie Rhee with the protected time and resources to allow her to pursue the training needed to reach her long-term goal of becoming an independent investigator in patient-centered clinical research and an expert in diabetes epidemiology. Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) management in chronic kidney disease (CKD) remains a challenge due to the complexity of multiple medication regimens that are often needed, and the required pharmacological dose adjustments and contraindications of several conventional antidiabetic medications. Barriers to achieving optimal T2DM management in CKD may include low patient adherence and conservative provider prescription decision making, resulting from a lack of long-term data on the safety and effectiveness regarding benefits and harms of certain medication classes over others in patients with CKD, particularly for newer medications with which there has been little clinical experience in the CKD population. The objective of the proposed research is to better understand the comparative safety and effectiveness of various strategies aimed to manage T2DM in CKD, and to understand factors that currently influence patient and provider choice of these strategies through a series of quantitative and qualitative studies. In aim 1, Dr. Rhee will conduct a descriptive study to quantify patterns of conventional and newer antidiabetic medication use across different stages of CKD and examine proportions of each medication prescribed by an endocrinologist, nephrologist, or primary care physician. In aim 2, Dr. Rhee will use a detailed administrative database to compare the safety and effectiveness of DPP-4 inhibitors and GLP-1 agonists versus conventional antidiabetic medications by examining associations with cardiovascular outcomes, glycemic control, weight gain, and hypoglycemia-related ED visits and hospitalizations. Effect modification by CKD stage will also be examined. In aim 3, Dr. Rhee will conduct a qualitative study to understand (1) the perspectives of patients on the use of antidiabetic drugs, including newer agents, and uncover perceived barriers to, and facilitators of, adherence; and (2) providers' perspectives on prescribing conventional and newer antidiabetic medications, and examine both clinical and nonclinical factors that influence their prescription decision making. This award will allow Dr. Rhee to transition into a clinically-minded epidemiologist whose work goes beyond quantitative research. It will help her fill critical training gaps in the areas of advanced pharmacoepidemiology, health services research, and qualitative research. The detailed training plan includes formal coursework at Stanford University as well as seminars, meetings, research apprenticeships, directed readings, and attendance at national/international conferences. The proposed work has high potential to make a significant public health and clinical impact. The sum of experiences acquired through this K01 will help Dr. Rhee to successfully transition toward an independent clinical research career.",1,1,,,,,,,drugs to manage diabetes in chronic kidney disease patients,1
20173229,Understanding patient engagement in lifestyle programs for diabetes prevention among women with a recent history of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM),"Type 2 diabetes affects over 13 million women in the US. Lifestyle programs to improve weight management, diet, and physical activity can prevent type 2 diabetes, are recommended for high-risk adults, and are increasingly available in health care delivery systems. Yet, while prior research has focused on the efficacy and effectiveness of lifestyle programs, little research has examined factors associated with patient engagement in lifestyle programs in real-world clinical settings. Low program participation and high attrition may contribute to poorer health outcomes for patients. Research on patient engagement is especially important for women with a history of gestational diabetes, who face markedly higher risk for type 2 diabetes. To advance the field of diabetes prevention and improve health care delivery for individuals at high risk, the overall objective of this proposal is to identify patient characteristics associated with engagement in an effective lifestyle program offered on behalf of an integrated health care delivery system to diverse women with a recent history of gestational diabetes. The project aims to determine patient characteristics that identify subgroups at risk for poor patient engagement (aim 1), and to develop meaningful descriptive profiles of these subgroups (aim 2). This secondary analysis leverages a unique source of electronic health record and patient-reported information. Results may creatively inform the future design of targeted outreach and curriculum materials to maximize program participation, with the ultimate goal of improving health in a young and diverse population at high risk for type 2 diabetes.",1,1,,,,,,,patient characteristics and adherence in lifestyle interventions,1
20181360,Comparative effectiveness of diabetes prevention programs,"The Marshallese are a Pacific Islander population experiencing significant health disparities in type 2 diabetes and associated risk factors. Marshallese and other Pacific Islanders are underrepresented in all types of health research. A lack of research has perpetuated disparities by limiting the availability and quality of information that informs patients', caregivers', and providers' decisions about the best way to prevent diabetes. The primary question from Marshallese patients and caregivers addressed by this research is the following: ""What can I do to prevent diabetes, and how can I help those I care about prevent diabetes?"" To address this question, we collaboratively reviewed potential strategies and selected comparators and outcomes that are meaningful to stakeholders. The Diabetes Prevention Program Lifestyle Intervention (DPP-LI) is an evidence-based program that has been shown to reduce weight, lower BMI, lower HbA1c, lower blood pressure, improve eating habits, and increase physical activity. While the DPP-LI has been effective at improving outcomes among the general population, among racial and ethnic populations, and across multiple settings, its effectiveness has not been adequately tested among Pacific Islanders in particular. The traditional DPP-LI has been tested among Pacific Islander participants with moderately positive outcomes; however, the results were hampered by attrition. A culturally adapted Pacific DPP-LI, which included half of the contact hours of the traditional DPP-LI, has shown positive results in Pacific Islander participants; however, the Pacific DPP-LI study did not include a control or comparison group, which left important gaps in knowledge about its comparative effectiveness with the traditional DPP-LI. Our overall goal is to reduce disparities related to type 2 diabetes within the Marshallese community. The proposed study is conducted in a real world setting and will determine whether the Pacific DPP-LI or the traditional DPP-LI is more effective in achieving clinically meaningful, patient centered outcomes with Marshallese participants. The proposed research is significant to a broad range of people and groups who have a stake in preventing diabetes and improving the health of Marshallese and other Pacific Islander communities. All aspects of this proposal have been collaboratively developed by both Marshallese and non-Marshallese stakeholders and researchers at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, with the goal of integrating indigenous Pacific knowledge and values with Western knowledge and the highest methodological standards.",1,1,1,,,,,,DPP in marshallese islanders,1
20183290,Role of diabetes and sedentary time in outcomes of structured exercise therapy for peripheral artery disease,"One of the primary risk factors for peripheral artery disease (PAD) is type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM); 20-30% of adults with DM have PAD. The combination of PAD and DM (PAD+DM) puts individuals at a greater risk of poor health outcomes, compared to either condition alone. This is particularly true in regard to cardiovascular conditions. In fact, the risk of mortality is two times higher in adults with PAD+DM than in those with PAD alone. While exercise has been shown to be an effective therapy for improving walking distance among adults with PAD, there are some individuals, particularly those with PAD+DM, who experience a blunted response to exercise therapy. It is not known whether an increase in sedentary time occurs with structured exercise therapy for PAD, and could, in part, explain why some individuals with PAD+DM do not experience the same benefits from structured exercise therapy as individuals without DM. The purpose of this pilot study is to determine if older adults with PAD, with and without DM, engaging in structured exercise therapy change their sedentary behavior and to determine the relationship between sedentary time, physical function, and quality of life, independent of physical activity. This study will use a prospective, pre-test post-test design and will include 50 older adults with PAD (25 with PAD+DM, 25 with PAD only) who are participating in a 12-week structured exercise therapy program. The aims of this study are to 1) evaluate the effect of structured exercise therapy on objectively measured, free-living sedentary time in older adults with PAD, with and without DM; and 2) determine if changes in sedentary time in the first 6 weeks of structured exercise therapy are associated with changes observed from baseline to 12 weeks in peak walking distance, physical function, falls, and quality of life in patients with PAD, with and without DM. At the completion of this study, we expect to have determined the variability, magnitude, and direction of change in sedentary time in older adults with PAD participating in structured exercise therapy and determined if the magnitude of change in sedentary time differs among older adults with PAD, with and without DM. We also expect to have determined if decreases in sedentary time are associated with improvements in peak walking distance, physical function, and quality of life and a reduction in falls, and if this relationship is independent of potential confounding variables (e.g., smoking, comorbidities, disease severity). The long-term goal of this research is to develop an intervention that can improve responsiveness to exercise interventions, reduce falls, and improve quality of life for older adults with PAD+DM. This study is significant because it could have a positive impact by helping older adults achieve optimal benefit from this method of self-management and reduce complications such as reduced physical function and decreased quality of life that are common in PAD. This improvement in quality of life and physical function could reduce morbidity and mortality, decrease health care costs, and help a growing population of older adults in the US with PAD enjoy greater health and wellbeing.",1,1,,,,,,,intervention for sedentary time among specific population with diabetes,1
20173073,Technology to improve the health of resource-poor Hispanics with diabetes,"I am an internist at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, Texas. My career goal is to become an independent clinical investigator and expert in improving diabetes care for resource-poor individuals by increasing community health worker (CHW) support. Receiving training and mentorship in community-based participatory research (CBPR) (learning goal [LG] 1), implementation research (LG2), and study design and implementation of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) (LG3) are necessities for me to achieve independence as an investigator. To achieve these goals, I organized a detailed career development plan with diverse coursework and a scientific mentoring team that includes John Foreyt, PhD (primary mentor, director of the DeBakey Heart Center's Behavioral Medicine Research Center, which conducts NIDDK-supported RCTs in diabetes), and 3 co-mentors, Aanand Naik, MD (an expert in the field of Implementation Research), David Hyman, MD, MPH (an internist/researcher in CBPR who conducts RCTs in low-income settings), and Susan Samson, MD, PhD (an endocrinologist in patient-oriented outcomes diabetes research). In addition, Charles Minard (a biostatistician researcher at Baylor), Sanjeev Arora, MD (founder/director of an internationally recognized organization [Project ECHO] that uses modalities [i.e., CHWs, telemedicine] to increase access to care), and the University of Texas CHW training program will be collaborators throughout my training. The number of Hispanics diagnosed with diabetes is escalating in the US with disproportionately higher prevalence and complication rates than other ethnicities. CHWs are a well-established and culturally sensitive means to bridge gaps in care to individuals with diabetes. However, CHWs are often left unsupported, placing patients at risk of substandard care or harm. Telemedicine is a term used to describe a range of technologies to support health care delivery via communication with the patient or a member of the health care delivery team. Though telemedicine has been implemented into diabetes programs for many years, there is a paucity of data showing the use of telemedicine for CHW training and support. In a pilot study, I initiated a CHW-led diabetes program for resource-poor Hispanics with in-person support for CHWs. The proposed research utilizes findings from the pilot study to evaluate the use of telemedicine support for CHWs who lead diabetes programs for resource-poor Hispanics. Specifically, I will conduct a RCT in 4 cohort waves with 176 adults diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. The study will compare clinical outcomes (specific aim 1) and treatment satisfaction (specific aim 2) of subjects who receive a CHW-led diabetes education program incorporating telemedicine support (T-CDEP) (intervention, n=88) to subjects who receive usual care (wait list control, n=88). In addition, I will analyze the acceptability of telemedicine use for CHWs (exploratory aim 1). The proposed research serves as the foundation for a multicenter, longitudinal study expanded to other ethnicities and settings (e.g., rural) for R01 submission prior to the completion of the 5-year K award period.",1,,1,,,,,,CHW-led diabetes intervention,1
20173151,Diabetes prevention culturally tailored for Mexican Americans,"Starr County is a poor Texas-Mexico border community that is 98% Mexican American and has the highest diabetes-related death rate in Texas. In previous Starr County studies, we tested interventions culturally tailored for Spanish-speaking Mexican Americans diagnosed with type 2 diabetes (T2DM). Each study participant was supported by a family member who also received program benefits; 70% of these supporters did not have diabetes. Compared to the control group, fewer non-diabetic supporters in the experimental group converted to diabetes by 12 months post study entry. The primary purpose of the proposed study is to test the effectiveness of our culturally tailored DSME intervention that will be adapted for preventing, or at least delaying, diabetes onset in Mexican Americans with prediabetes. The intervention will involve 1) 12 two-hour weekly group educational sessions that emphasize eating and preparing healthy Mexican American foods and increasing physical activity; 2) 15 two-hour bi-weekly/monthly support group sessions on problem solving the barriers to adopting healthier lifestyles; and 3) three booster sessions held at 6-month intervals. We will integrate aspects of the Diabetes Prevention Program, as well as motivational interviewing, and prior to intervention testing, we will conduct focus groups with key individuals in Starr County to confirm the strategy and obtain community support. Intervention effectiveness will be examined using a randomized, repeated measures, pretest/posttest control group design, with an ""enhanced"" usual care control group. We will enroll 300 Mexican Americans with verified prediabetes from rosters of ongoing Starr County genetic studies. Groups of 10 will be constituted according to the area of the county in which people live; each group will be randomly assigned to experimental or control conditions. Growth curve analysis, using multilevel models, will be used to compare intervention effects on health outcomes over time. We hypothesize that participants in the experimental group, compared to the control group, will have better health outcomes (A1C, FBG, lipids, BP, physical activity, dietary intake, and anthropometric variables [BMI, waist circumference]) at 3, 6, 12, 24, and 36 months post baseline, as well as lower rates of converting to T2DM (OGTT) by 36 months.

20173156,Integrated community-clinical linkage model to promote weight loss among South Asians with pre-diabetes,"The proposed project will build on a well-established collaboration between researchers at the NYU School of Medicine, Health First (the largest Medicaid insurer in NYC), New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, clinical practices, and community partners to promote diabetes prevention among NYC South Asians. The goal of this study is to test the effectiveness and assess the implementation process of an integrated intervention to support weight loss for South Asian patients at risk for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in primary care settings. The integrated intervention has two components: an electronic health record (EHR)-based component to increase screening and identification of South Asian patients who are at risk of T2DM; and 2) a registry-driven community health worker (CHW)-led health coaching component. Using a stepped-wedge design, we will implement the study in 25 NYC primary care practice (PCPs) sites enrolling 2,840 South Asian patients at risk for T2DM. The project has two specific aims. First, we will test the effectiveness of an integrated EHR-based intervention (i.e., an alert to screen at-risk patients and a registry function to track outcomes) plus CHW-led coaching of registered patients compared with usual care. The primary outcome is >5% weight loss among South Asian patients at risk for T2DM. Second, using a mixed-methods approach and the RE-AIM (reach, efficacy/effectiveness, adoption, implementation, maintenance) evaluation framework, we will systematically assess the implementation process and delineate factors that influence adoption, sustainability, and scalability of an integrated EHR-CHW intervention within applied practice settings. The integrated EHR-CHW protocol will support team-based care by allowing for feedback between providers and CHWs, who will be providing health education to participants while actively participating in patient management with providers.",1,1,1,1,,,,,EHR alert to screen plus CHW delivered lifestyle intervention,1
20173163,Effectiveness trial of an e-health intervention to support diabetes care in minority youth,"The deterioration in diabetes self-management (DSM) and metabolic control associated with the adolescent developmental period is well known. African American adolescents with type 1 diabetes (T1D) are at even higher risk for such problems. Research has shown that parenting behaviors such as parental monitoring of adolescent completion of daily diabetes care are critical predictors of youth DSM. Low levels of parental monitoring are even more likely to result in poor DSM among youth with T1D from minority or low-income homes. Few studies targeting adolescents have demonstrated that behavioral interventions can improve DSM or metabolic control, and no clinical trials have focused exclusively on African American youth. Furthermore, there have been no published clinical trials of interventions that have targeted parental monitoring of daily diabetes care as a means of improving DSM in adolescents. Computer-delivered, brief interventions have shown promising effects in a number of areas of behavioral health care and may also increase the accessibility of behavioral health interventions to minority families. Our group has recently conducted a pilot efficacy trial to test a brief, three-session computer intervention aimed at increasing parental motivation for supervision and monitoring among caregivers of young African American adolescents who are beginning to transition to independent self-care. Although the intervention was designed for delivery in diabetes clinics at regularly scheduled appointments, for the purpose of our efficacy pilot, it was delivered either in the clinic or in the home if the family missed their scheduled clinic appointment. Results from the efficacy study suggested that caregivers who received the intervention had significantly higher monitoring of their adolescent's daily diabetes management. Adolescents whose caregivers received the intervention had significant improvements in metabolic control compared to controls. The purpose of the proposed study is to conduct a multicenter, randomized effectiveness trial of the intervention with 212 African American adolescents with T1D and their primary caregivers recruited from pediatric endocrinology clinics across the United States. A hybrid 1 design will be used, allowing implementation science questions about barriers/facilitators to intervention adoption in real-world pediatric diabetes care clinics to be addressed. Caregiver-adolescent dyads will be randomly assigned to one of two study arms: caregiver motivational computer intervention for parental monitoring of diabetes care or caregiver attention control. The intervention will be delivered at three consecutive clinic appointments occurring over 12 months but will only be delivered in the diabetes clinic to determine if the intervention can improve DSM and health outcomes under real-world, effectiveness conditions. Dose effects and moderators of treatment outcomes will also be evaluated. If successful, the intervention has the potential to improve health outcomes and to contribute to the integration of behavioral health interventions into routine medical care in a vulnerable population of youth.",1,1,1,,,,,,computer delivered intervention to parent-child dyads,1
20173239,Evaluation of a Lifestyle Intervention Adopted for Clinical Practice for Diabetes Prevention (ELEVATE-DP),"The Diabetes Prevention Program was a landmark randomized controlled trial that demonstrated the efficacy of a structured and comprehensive lifestyle intervention in preventing type 2 diabetes (T2D). Due to its large success, it was adapted for use in community settings by changing the intensive, individualized (one-on-one) lifestyle intervention to a facilitated, group-based intervention (Group Lifestyle BalanceTM [GLB]). While the GLB program has been associated with modest improvements in weight management and a reduced incidence of T2D in various community-based settings, reach has been limited. Health care system settings hold great potential for implementing behavioral lifestyle interventions due to the clinical resources and access to patients at risk for T2D. Natural experiments resulting from the spontaneous and organic implementation of evidence-based interventions, such as GLB, into a real-world clinical practice provide a rare and exciting opportunity to examine effectiveness in a truly pragmatic context. In the proposed study, Evaluation of a Lifestyle Intervention Adopted for Clinical Practice for Diabetes Prevention (ELEVATE-DP), we seek to evaluate the GLB program after its integration within a large, health care delivery system, Sutter Health (SH) of Northern California. SH is a mixed-payer environment and operates as a fee-for-service organization, much like the U.S. health care system as a whole. In 2010, two of the five regional affiliates independently launched GLB programs. This allows for the unique opportunity to rigorously evaluate the real-world effectiveness of the GLB program after integration within a health care system, with high potential for the generalizability of findings to other similar health systems in the U.S. This study will employ a rigorous mixed-methods evaluation approach, using a large, comprehensive electronic health records (EHR) system, GLB program records, and prospectively collected primary data from past and present GLB administrators, facilitators, and participants, as well as eligible non-participants. We will use the EHR to retrospectively identify GLB participants (N=5,000) and a matched usual care cohort (non-GLB participants; N=10,000) between 2010 and 2016, and will add four years of additional data (2017-2020). The specific aims are to 1) evaluate the clinical effectiveness of GLB relative to usual care; 2) evaluate the impact of GLB on health care resource utilization and costs relative to usual care, including a formal cost-effectiveness analysis; and 3) evaluate the implementation and fidelity of GLB within and across SH regional divisions and clinics using a comparative mixed-methods process evaluation. This study will identify important barriers to, and facilitators of, translating an efficacious diabetes prevention intervention into routine clinical practice outside of a research setting.",1,,1,,,,,1,group lifestyle balance intervention implemented at the worksite. ,1
20173262,Diabetes Risk Education and Communication Trial (DiRECT) for primary care patients with prediabetes,"Large randomized trials have found that intensive lifestyle interventions (ILI) and metformin are safe and effective treatment options for preventing diabetes among adults with prediabetes. However, these treatments are rarely used, and little existing research has focused on patient-centered approaches for promoting their use. A large body of evidence suggests that risk communication interventions are a promising method for motivating patients to adopt diverse preventive health behaviors. But this approach has not been definitively studied in the context of diabetes prevention. Therefore, the content, structure, and process for communicating diabetes risk to adults with prediabetes is not known. We plan to address this critical knowledge gap by developing and pilot testing the Diabetes Risk Education and Communication Trial (DiRECT) intervention among primary care patients with prediabetes. This novel intervention, delivered by medical assistants before patients' routinely scheduled office visits, consists of the following three components intended to promote initiation of ILI and metformin: 1) a prediabetes decision aid focused on diabetes risk and treatment options for preventing diabetes, 2) a ""think aloud"" exercise, and 3) formulating a preliminary treatment plan. Previous studies report that medical assistants can improve uptake of some preventive health services in primary care, which may also be true for ILI and metformin. We will test this hypothesis by completing the following specific aims. In aim 1 we will develop the DiRECT intervention using materials that our group has created and pilot tested in the target population. We will engage an expert advisory panel of stakeholders in diabetes prevention, who will help develop the intervention so that it can be widely disseminated if found to be effective. Aim 2 will evaluate the effects of the DiRECT intervention on patients' perceived risk of developing diabetes and their intention to adopt treatment, in addition to other factors that may impact treatment decisions. Aim 3 is a pilot randomized trial of DiRECT vs. usual care in 80 primary care patients with prediabetes (40 in each arm). This pilot pragmatic trial will estimate the preliminary effects of DiRECT on the following 3-month outcomes: initiation of ILI and/or metformin (primary), adherence to these treatment(s), and weight loss. We will also examine the intervention's acceptability, impact on clinical workflows, and costs. We hypothesize that the empirically developed DiRECT intervention will improve the accuracy of participants' risk perceptions and increase their initiation of treatments to prevent diabetes. This study will be conducted in a large community health center, in which 90% of patients with prediabetes are racial/ethnic minorities and 83% live in poverty. Our proposal is responsive to PAR-15-158 by 1) including a low-income, diverse population; 2) using medical assistants, a workforce that is ubiquitous and therefore scalable to most primary care settings; and 3) leveraging an existing data infrastructure to pragmatically assess participants' eligibility and collect their clinical data.",1,1,,1,,,,,individual treatment plan for prediabetes,1
20173289,A big data research study on the relationship between metformin use and dementia,"Dementia is a common and greatly feared condition associated with aging. In the United States, the prevalence of dementia is expected to nearly triple to 13 million persons by 2050. Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), a risk factor for dementia, is also rapidly increasing. Emerging data suggests the first-line treatment for T2DM, metformin, may decrease dementia risk. In animal models, metformin improves memory and appears to protect against dementia. If this finding is established in humans, it could inform clinical decisions including how early in the course of diabetes to initiate metformin and whether to continue metformin when patients transition to insulin. However, definitive data are lacking. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have not been conducted to study whether metformin prevents dementia in humans. It would be premature to conduct an RCT given the current state of the literature and the high cost and long follow-up time required. Inconsistent results from extant observational studies may be due to inadequate control for confounding. The current proposal uses rich electronic health data resources from the Veterans Health Administration (VA) and Group Health (GH), an integrated health care system in the northwest United States, to conduct a rigorous retrospective cohort study of the association between metformin use and incident dementia. We will use electronic health records (EHR) to identify a cohort of about 100,000 VA patients and 20,000 GH patients who have T2DM and are free of dementia and not taking diabetes medications at baseline. We will use a new user design and state-of-the-art analytic methods including propensity scores and inverse probability of treatment weighting to control for potential confounding factors including diabetes severity. The long observation periods (17 years in VA and 20 years in GH) will ensure adequate power. The rich EHR data, including diagnoses, procedures, and laboratory and vital signs measures, will enable us to control for many potential confounding factors such as hemoglobin A1c levels, medical and psychiatric comorbidities, and the use of concomitant medications. The primary analysis will use VA data, and findings will be replicated using GH data; independent replication in two unique large health care systems will improve the validity of our findings. We will address the following specific aims: 1) compare risk of dementia in people initiating metformin for T2DM versus those initiating a sulfonylurea, 2) compare risk of dementia in people initiating metformin vs. those delaying initial pharmacologic therapy, and 3) determine if the metformin-dementia association varies by age groups (50-65 vs. >65 years of age) and by gender. Exploratory analysis will investigate metformin dose and duration and risk of dementia. By using the same measures and methods to replicate results in very different patient populations, we will generate the strongest evidence to date regarding metformin's potential to reduce risk of dementia. Results will inform provider-patient discussions about metformin use and could guide design of a subsequent, efficient RCT that targets people most likely to benefit from metformin.",1,1,,,,,,,metformin,1
20182178,"Screening, brief intervention, and referral to treatment (SBIRT) outcomes in a low-income population","The goal of the proposed research is to investigate the impact of screening, brief intervention, and referral to treatment (SBIRT) for alcohol and drug use on subsequent health care utilization. We propose further analysis of a unique existing data set, which includes data generated by Wisconsin's SAMHSA-funded primary care SBIRT program, linked to Medicaid claims data for 16,789 Medicaid recipients. The Wisconsin Initiative to Promote Healthy Lifestyles (WIPHL) SBIRT program provided services in diverse primary care sites, using paraprofessionals in the universal delivery of SBIRT. This innovation is central, given the time and financial constraints of physician-led SBIRT. If the analysis yields promising results, this study will serve as preliminary data for an R01 proposal. The study design uses an SBIRT treatment group of 7,367 adult Medicaid beneficiaries (ages 18-64) from 22 primary care sites, and a comparison group of 9,422 sex-matched beneficiaries from 41 comparable non-SBIRT clinic sites. Primary utilization outcomes are 1) outpatient visits (days); 2) inpatient length of stay (days), inpatient admissions; 4) emergency department admissions; and 5) utilization of substance abuse and mental health specialty care services, all during one year before and two years after the SBIRT index date. Associated costs will also be estimated based on reimbursement rates calculated from Medicaid fee-for-service claims. To assess the primary aim of estimating overall impact on health care utilization, a hierarchical (individuals clustered within clinics) difference-in-differences approach will be used to assess change in utilization between the two groups. A second aim of analysis will investigate type-2 diabetes as a potential moderator of SBIRT's impact on health care utilization. Risky alcohol use among diabetics can significantly affect type 2 diabetes-related health and health care visits, increasing the cost of managing diabetes. We hypothesize that SBIRT services for individuals with diabetes will significantly reduce the use of high-cost inpatient and emergency department care, thereby decreasing overall health care cost due to better diabetes management and control. A third aim will investigate the effectiveness of screening only compared to screening plus brief intervention among individuals who screened positive for binge drinking. This proposed research using existing data will lead to future rigorous research on the effectiveness of paraprofessional-administered SBIRT and is likely to inform the decisions of Medicaid systems and other health insurers regarding SBIRT coverage and services provided by paraprofessionals. The study will expand the evidence base regarding SBIRT and, assuming positive cost offset findings, could significantly impact the uptake of SBIRT paraprofessional-led services. Studying diabetes as a moderator could influence diabetes care teams and diabetes support programs to include alcohol screening and brief intervention as a primary strategy for improving self-management behaviors. The study will also elucidate the added effectiveness of brief intervention compared to screening alone.",1,1,1,,,,,,brief intervention with physician on hospitalizations,1
20194040,Health and economic impacts of coverage requirements and health system-community coordination for diabetes prevention,"Currently, 86 million Americans have prediabetes, but 9 in 10 of them remain unaware. Randomized trials have demonstrated that more than half of all new cases of type 2 diabetes can be prevented or delayed when high-risk adults are offered resource-intensive lifestyle intervention programs, such as the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP). While numerous organizations have engaged in efforts to expand screening and subsequent access to interventions for adults with prediabetes, those services are far from routine in clinical and public health practice. However, implementation efforts in this arena are expected to accelerate rapidly during the next 3 years as several forthcoming policies will catalyze efforts to identify and intervene upon prediabetes. The US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recently issued a grade B recommendation that all overweight or obese adults with cardiovascular risk conditions (including prediabetes) be offered intensive lifestyle interventions, specifically referencing the DPP as a case example. This recommendation, together with Affordable Care Act (ACA) legislation requiring commercial and public payers to provide coverage of USPSTF A and B recommendations, has led payers to begin structuring coverage policies that will include a mix of clinical and community intervention services. In parallel, key stakeholders such as YMCA of the USA and the American Medical Association (AMA) have engineered a series of strategic regional initiatives to strengthen health care-community linkages for the screening and diagnosis of prediabetes, as well as the coordination of referrals to community-based interventions, and the billing and payment for delivery of those interventions. In close collaboration with these stakeholders, we propose this natural experiment, employing a mix of qualitative and quantitative research methods, and leveraging available data from the Health Care Cost Institute (HCCI), OptumHealth Care Solutions, and other accessible sources to evaluate the reach, implementation, effectiveness, and costs of these interrelated policies likely to impact the prevention of type 2 diabetes for potentially several million Americans over the next 5 to 10 years. Our proposal aims to (1) evaluate and compare the impacts of large-scale, regional health care-community linkages on changing rates of prediabetes screening, diagnosis, and National DPP intervention attendance following enactment of USPSTF recommendations for those services; (2) describe implementation features and elicit barriers and facilitators of implementation, replication, and future scaling of large-scale regional initiatives; and (3) compare the effects of exposure to the YMCA's DPP on health care costs and utilization for different subgroups of patients with prediabetes. This evaluation will provide critical information about whether particular strategies should be discontinued, refined, or replicated on a larger scale to achieve maximal impact over the coming decade.",1,,1,,1,,,,coverage policies for USPFTF graded interventions,1
20173348,Enhancing social support for diabetes self-management among men and women veterans,"Background: Diabetes affects 25% of Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) patients and is among the leading causes of morbidity and mortality. Self-management, including healthy eating, being physically active, and taking medications, is critical to preventing diabetes complications, but many veterans do not adhere to self-management recommendations. Enhancing the quality and quantity of existing social support resources is a promising strategy to improve self-management among veterans, as self-management behaviors are influenced by a patient's social network. However, little is known about veterans' existing social support resources for self-management, how to best leverage social support to facilitate self-management, and whether there are differences by gender. Objectives: The proposed research will adapt and pilot test a virtual intervention that includes veterans with diabetes and support persons, which aims to reduce unsupportive and enhance supportive behaviors to facilitate veterans' self-management. Aim 1 is to characterize social support resources, perceptions of supportive and unsupportive behaviors related to diabetes self-management, and facilitators and barriers to engaging in a partnered self-management intervention. Aim 2 is to identify support person perceptions of supportive and unsupportive behaviors for veterans' self-management and facilitators and barriers to engaging in a partnered self-management intervention. Aim 3 is to evaluate feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary clinical improvement of a partnered diabetes self-management intervention in a single-arm pilot trial (n=20 men, n=20 women) employing a mixed-methods approach. Methods: Aim 1 will utilize individual qualitative telephone interviews with veterans (n=32) to characterize social support resources for self-management. Aim 2 will involve individual qualitative telephone interviews with support persons identified by veterans in aim 1 (e.g., spouses, adult children, and friends; n=16) to understand their perceptions of helpful and harmful support. Lastly, aim 3 will use both qualitative and quantitative methods to pilot test modifications to an existing partnered self-management intervention and evaluate feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary clinical improvement in self-management behaviors and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) overall and by gender. Impact: Diabetes is highly prevalent among veterans with profound impacts on health and wellbeing. Innovative, veteran-centric interventions are needed to improve diabetes self-management. The proposed research has the potential to fill this gap, particularly for women veterans who are often included in very limited numbers in VA intervention studies. If effective, this strategy could be tailored to other chronic diseases or disease prevention. The project aims align with VA's Blueprint for Excellence strategies of anticipating and meeting the unique needs of veterans; delivering high-quality, veteran-centered care; and advancing personalized, proactive, and patient-driven care.",1,,1,,,,,,social support for veterans with diabetes,1
20174028,Corazon de la Familia (Heart of the Family),"Hispanics have significantly higher rates of type 2 diabetes (T2D) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk burden compared to non-Hispanic whites. Dramatic increases in rates of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease in U.S. Hispanics are anticipated as the population ages and acculturation lends to engagement in unhealthy behaviors. Culturally appropriate lifestyle modification strategies are needed for effective risk reduction. Most lifestyle modification strategies have focused on individuals and sustained engagement in healthy behaviors is seldom achieved. Respectful of the Hispanic cultural value of familismo, prioritizing of the well-being of the family over that of the individual, we propose to conduct a family dyad-focused intervention that addresses family members as active participants in a lifestyle intervention for Hispanics with high risk for T2D or CVD. ""Corazon de la Familia"" (""Heart of the Family"") is a promotores- (community health workers) facilitated intervention that integrates evidence-based education and health behavior skills development with social support strategies through the involvement of family members. We will conduct a randomized controlled trial using a 2-group design and compare the short-term and long-term impact of the family dyad-focused active intervention to an individual-focused control condition on biological and behavioral T2D and CVD risk factors. Furthermore, we will determine how each active intervention dyad member's engagement in healthy lifestyle behaviors and level of support for their partner's engagement in healthy lifestyle behaviors affects their own and their partner's outcomes. Guided by community-based participatory research principles, our community-academic partnership was formed in response to needs recognized by Hispanic residents of Kentucky for socioculturally tailored health promotion programs to reduce T2D and CVD risk. Hispanic community partners have been integrally involved in all phases of sociocultural tailoring and pilot testing the Corazon de la Familia intervention. The result of the work of our community-academic partnership is a family dyad-focused intervention that provides a unique approach to sustain engagement in healthy lifestyle behaviors to reduce T2D and CVD risk among at-risk Hispanics. Further, this community-based intervention has significant potential for broad implementation to successfully address T2D and CVD health disparities across U.S. Hispanic communities.",1,,1,,,,,,community health worker delivered intervention plus social support,1
20173123,Improving diabetes care through effective personalized patient portal interactions,"Background: Currently over 3 million veterans have been registered for the VA patient portal, My HealtheVet (MHV). The portal's features, such as enabling veterans to refill their medications, send secure messages to their clinical teams, and read their clinician's notes, are integral to VHA's goal of expanding veteran-facing virtual modalities. Use of MHV features has been associated with improvements in diabetes physiologic measures. However, use of MHV features varies considerably, and little is known about how patients and clinical teams can best leverage features to improve self-management, health care processes and outcomes. Objectives: This study is designed to uncover the patient portal features associated with improved outcomes and clarify how patients can best leverage them to manage their diabetes. Our primary objectives are to (aim 1) generate new information for feature selection and personalizing interventions, (aim 2) generate details about how patients are effectively using the patient portal, and (aim 3) conduct a small-scale experiment to test the feasibility of engaging veterans in a supported adoption intervention to promote effective MHV use in veterans with diabetes. Methods: Aims 1 and 2 will use a longitudinal cohort-with-nested-case-control design to learn how patients with diabetes use the portal and what patterns of use are associated with better outcomes. Qualitative data from aim 2 and veteran co-investigators will provide direct veteran input (strategies for success) into the intervention delivered in aim 3. Aim 1: In a national longitudinal cohort of veterans with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes receiving care in the VHA, we will test the association of patient portal feature use with improvements in physiologic measures of control (HbA1c, LDL, and blood pressure) and whether the association differs for patients with mental health conditions or those in rural areas. Aim 2: Our goal is to collect data on at least 200 patients with good glycemic (HbA1c) control (cases) and at least 200 with poor control (controls). Using surveys, secure message coding, and in-depth semi-structured interviews with a subset of about 40-50 patients (approximately 20-25 from each of the above groups), we will examine differences in portal feature use, communication with the clinical team (information sharing, information seeking, socio-emotional exchange), and in sharing information from their portals with family and/or non-VA providers. Aim 3: We will conduct a small-scale experiment, using a randomized encouragement design, to test the feasibility of engaging veterans in a supported adoption intervention to promote effective MHV use, in a sample of 200 veterans with diabetes with or without comorbid mental health diagnoses. Participants randomized in the encouragement arm will receive additional support, such as a mailing, one-on-one and group sessions, and follow-up support. Those in the comparison condition will receive a mailing with only the goal setting content. Findings: There are no findings yet. Impact: This research will help clarify which portal features are associated with a greater likelihood of achieving controlled diabetes outcomes, and whether those features benefit all veterans with diabetes equally, or whether the overall effect masks group-level differences which must be accounted for in order to optimize the quality of care for all. These findings will be of critical importance not only to VA, but to other health care systems as well that are currently implementing PHR portals, and that serve patient populations faced with complex, chronic health care needs.",1,,,1,,,,1,patient portal use,1
20172055,Pathways to Prevention Workshop: methods for evaluating natural experiments in obesity,"Review question(s): KQ1. What population-based data sources have been used in studies of how programs, policies, or built environment changes affect or are associated with obesity prevention and control outcomes? KQ2. What methods have been used to link different population-based data sources? KQ3. What obesity measures, dietary and physical behaviors, and other outcomes have been assessed in studies of how programs, policies or built environment changes affect or are associated with obesity prevention and control? KQ4. Which experimental and non-experimental methods have been used in studies of how programs, policies, or built environment changes affect or are associated with obesity prevention and control outcomes? KQ5. What are the risks of bias in studies of how programs, policies, or built environment changes affect or are associated with obesity prevention and control outcomes? KQ6. What methodological/analytic advances (e.g., data system features, approaches to linking data sources, or analytic methods) would help to strengthen efforts to estimate the effect of programs, policies, or built environment changes on obesity prevention and control? Searches: We will search PubMed, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and EconLit. We will explore the availability and usefulness of additional sources that have articles on the built environment and transportation. A search strategy will be developed for PubMed, and will be used as a guide to develop search strategies in the other search engines. Index articles will be used during the search development to ensure that an appropriate set of studies is captured by the search strategy. We will search for articles authored in English and published between 2000 to present. The search will be supplemented with a hand search to identify references in other published relevant systematic and narrative reviews. Articles will be selected through independent screening by two screeners based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria described in PICOTS. We have compiled a list of agencies and organizations that conduct evaluations of policies and programs aimed at preventing or controlling obesity. We will search the websites of these organizations to identify white papers or unpublished evaluations. The principal inclusion and exclusion criteria for the systematic literature review will be derived from the identified PICOTS framework. We will search for all studies on programs or policies targeting obesity prevention and control in people of any age to identify potential data sources. We will include programs or policies implemented in any country. We will exclude smaller studies with fewer than 100 subjects because of the review's goal of identifying population-based studies. We have created a list of commonly used validated instruments to assess obesity-related individual-level behavioral outcomes. This list will be a starting point to determine inclusion of the articles that include dietary or physical activity behavioral outcomes, but no weight or BMI measures. When we identify instruments not listed, we will assess whether the study provides a reference for the validation of the instrument, and if so, we will add the instrument to our list and include the article. If no validated instrument is used, we will exclude the study from full data abstraction. We will maintain a list of these excluded articles that used non-validated instruments for diet and physical activity assessments. Studies will not be included if published prior to 2000. In 2001, the U.S. Surgeon General released a report entitled, ""The Surgeon General's Call To Action To Prevent and Decrease Overweight and Obesity,"" to call attention to the major public health problem of obesity. The publication of this report marked a shift toward directing public health funding and policies toward the prevention and control of obesity, and sparked new research in this area. We will include studies that report on one of the following outcomes of interest: obesity measures (either body weight or BMI) and obesity-related individual health behaviors (dietary and physical activity behaviors). Studies will be excluded if they do not report any of these outcomes. Types of study to be included: There will be no restrictions on study types or designs. The condition or domain being studied is evaluation of natural experiments in obesity. Participants/population: We will include all ages of the general population; and sub-populations of obese and overweight individuals. We will consider stratifying by subgroups: age, race/ethnicity, gender, rural/urban, or clinical conditions (e.g., type 2 diabetes, pre-diabetes, elevated cardiovascular risk). We will exclude studies within specific clinical populations only, other than obese/overweight populations (e.g., populations with severe mental illness, people with genetic predispositions for obesity); and studies with fewer than 100 subjects in order to achieve the focus on population-based programs and policies. Intervention(s), exposure(s): We will include U.S. and non-U.S. policies, programs, and built environment changes targeting a population. We will exclude programs or policies targeting the individual level (not system or population level), such as Weight Watchers; programs or policies which include multiple levels of intervention (e.g., population-level and individual-level), will be considered for inclusion. Comparator(s)/control: We will include (1) studies with a clearly defined comparison group either prior to the policy, or a defined group without exposure to the policy or program. The comparison group does not need to be concurrent; and (2) observational or cohort studies that use regression models to assess the association of a policy or program on an exposed versus an unexposed group. We will exclude studies without a comparison or unexposed group. Context: All settings. Outcome(s): Primary outcomes: We will include (A) outcomes of interest (need to be one or more of these: see Appendix B, list of outcome measures [to be made available in the published protocol]): (1) body weight; (2) body mass index; (3) individual physical activity behavior assessed using a validated questionnaire that assesses both quantity and type of activity, or measures physical activity objectively (e.g., step counts); (and 4) individual dietary behavior assessed using a validated questionnaire, measuring one or more of the following: (a) total daily caloric intake; (b) specific dietary macronutrients related to obesity: vegetable, fruit, or fiber intake; and (c) specific eating behaviors associated with obesity: sugar sweetened beverage intake, or fast food consumption frequency; and (B) programs and policies enacted or implemented in the year 2000 or later. The U.S. Surgeon General's Call To Action To Prevent and Decrease Overweight and Obesity was published in 2001 and marked a turning point to raise public health awareness about obesity. Secondary outcomes are (1) co-outcomes to be considered only if at least one required outcome is also reported: food-environment, physical activity environment, commuting behavior, purchasing behavior, or urban renewal; and (2) programs and policies enacted or implemented in the year 2000 or later. The U.S. Surgeon General's Call To Action To Prevent and Decrease Overweight and Obesity was published in 2001 and marked a turning point to raise public health awareness about obesity. Data extraction, (selection and coding): Two trained research assistants will abstract data. We will abstract data about the study characteristics (e.g., year of publication, country), study design, participant and population characteristics, details about the policy and programs (year of enactment, type of legislation/policy, location of policy [e.g. state, country, locality], original goal of policy/program [diet, physical activity, both, other]) data sources and linkages, and analytic methods. See below for additional data abstraction elements by KQ. We will assess how each of the outcomes has been measured and the validated references for instruments not listed in Appendix B (see Appendix B for the list of commonly used dietary and physical activity instruments [to be made available in the published protocol]). After data have been abstracted, an independent data abstraction expert will review a random sample for quality assurance. Inconsistencies in data abstraction will be resolved by a consensus approach involving the research assistants and the expert reviewer. If consensus is not attainable for a specific case, it will be discussed among the rest of the review team and resolved by a majority vote. The same process will be used for all data abstraction activities throughout this review project. Risk of bias (quality) assessment: We will also abstract detailed information on confounders and types of adjustment. In addition to using the EPHPP tool to provide an overall risk of bias assessment, we will assess risk of bias concerns unique to each of the study designs and analytic methods employed. Below we describe specific analytic methods and context for the non-experimental studies we anticipate identifying in the literature search. Instrumental variable methods are sometimes referred to as ""natural experiments"" or ""randomized encouragement designs."" In cases where the intervention under study is not randomized, investigators attempt to identify an ""instrument"" that is related to receipt of the intervention and randomly distributed (or at least hypothetically randomly assigned), but is not related to the outcome. Instrumental variable analyses rely on finding a good instrument. Bias will be introduced if the instrument shares a common cause with the outcome, directly influences the outcome (not just through the treatment of interest), or the instrument is not randomly distributed. We will assess bias specific to instrumental variable methods. Regression discontinuity methods take advantage of existing rules or cutoff points that determine receipt of the intervention of interest (e.g., individuals above some BMI threshold receive an intervention; those below that threshold do not). Persons just above or just below the cutoff are assumed to be very similar, so comparing these groups allows for a valid estimate of the effect of the intervention. Bias may be introduced if the cutoff for assigning the intervention is unclear or can be manipulated, and regression discontinuity methods also rely on functional form assumptions (relating the assignment variable to the outcome) that need to be assessed. We will assess bias specific to regression discontinuity methods. Propensity score methods. As mentioned above, experimental designs are able to achieve balance between treatment and control groups on all covariates, both observed and unobserved. Propensity score methods attempt to achieve this covariate balance, at least among the observed covariates. Comparisons can then be made between those who are similar on important factors to isolate the effect of the exposure. Propensity score methods are only as strong as the data available: confounders that were unmeasured or not included in the development of propensity score may bias effect estimates. We will assess bias specific to propensity score methods. Interrupted time-series methods aim to model changes in the outcome before and after the intervention occurs. The stronger interrupted time-series designs also incorporate a comparison group that did not experience the intervention of interest at any time point; this enables better modeling of trends over time in the absence of the intervention. Interrupted time-series methods make assumptions about how the outcome of interest would have changed over time in the absence of the intervention. For example, in a simple interrupted time series, the assumption is that the trend in outcome would have continued in the same way as before the intervention time point. In a comparative interrupted time-series model, the assumption is that the difference in trends between the exposed and comparison groups would have continued in the same way after the intervention time point. Another assumption is that there is no other change at the time of the intervention that may affect the outcome, as well as a reliance on the model forms modeling the outcome over time. We will assess bias specific to interrupted time series. Strategy for data synthesis: By key questions, the strategy is as follows: Key question 1: What population-based data sources have been used in studies of how programs, policies, or built environment changes affect or are associated with obesity prevention and control outcomes? Key question 2. What methods have been used to link different population-based data sources? The main product from KQ1 will be a list and description of all data sources and data systems, and categories of variables they contain. We will describe the data sources by criteria for population-based data systems, whether the data source is in the NCCOR registry, and what country, state, or community it is from. We will organize the list of data systems by their usefulness for research and policy stakeholders. For KQ2 we will qualitatively describe the methods currently used to link these data systems (see KQ2 data abstraction). Potential incompleteness of the data abstraction may introduce errors and consequently biases in these findings. For example, not all data systems provide enough details about their data specifications and thus may lead to missing information. This may result in incomplete coding for a number of data systems. Consequently, the data aggregation may not be accomplished across all coding attributes and all data systems. The data synthesis will probably involve various denominators of data systems, thus limiting the generalizability of some of the findings. Data will also be aggregated and summarized across various coding schema attributes. The summary report will include various data system attributes across the entire list of data systems. The report will be accompanied with suggestions on which data specifications (e.g., linkage methods) have been found to be effective and which ones have faced challenges. Key question 3. What obesity measures, dietary and physical behaviors, and other outcomes have been assessed in studies of how programs, policies, or built environment changes affect or are associated with obesity prevention and control? We will describe counts of the number of studies that report each outcome and categories of outcomes of interest. We will also describe the types of measures or instruments used to assess these outcomes, and whether the policies had a positive, negative, or neutral effect on the outcomes, taking into consideration whether reported differences are statistically significant and/or clinically important. We will stratify these tables by outcomes, and by country. Key question 4. Which experimental and non-experimental methods have been used in studies of how programs, policies, or built environment changes affect or are associated with obesity prevention and control outcomes? Key question 5. What are the risks of bias in studies of how programs, policies, or built environment changes affect or are associated with obesity prevention and control outcomes? We recognize that the ultimate goal of this key question is to identify methods that would provide lower bias and higher validity in using multiple data systems in evaluating obesity prevention and control policies and programs. We will describe types of study designs and analytic methods being used, their frequency of use, and whether they are preferred for certain policies, policies, or data sources. We will also describe the risk of bias assessments across all studies and by study design. Key question 6. What methodological/analytic advances (e.g., data system features, approaches to linking data sources, or analytic methods) would help to strengthen efforts to estimate the effect of programs, policies, or built environment changes on obesity prevention and control? The goal of this project is not to analyze or prioritize the gaps identified by the TEP. The goal is to identify potential gaps and to present them in an unbiased manner. Analysis of subgroups or subsets: None planned at this time. Dissemination plans: The results of the review will be presented to the NIH in December of 2017 at a Pathways to Prevention meeting.",1,,,,1,1,,,systematic review of community and policy strategies,1
20173176,Hemoglobin A1c variability and adverse health outcomes,"Background: A major focus of diabetes management is glucose control, since persistently elevated hemoglobin A1c (A1c) levels predict adverse health outcomes. There are evolving data showing that glucose variability plays a role in predicting risk of complications. Longer term variability as reflected in A1c fluctuations over time has been linked to risk of microvascular and macrovascular complications. We have shown that increasing A1c variability over a 3-year period is independently associated with risk of myocardial infarction, ambulatory care sensitive condition hospitalization, and mortality. In this study we are developing and validating a novel clinical measure of A1c variability for its potential clinical application. Objectives: We are conducting an observational study based on the following specific objectives: Objective 1 is to construct statistical measures and determine the predictors of A1c variability. Objective 2 is to develop and validate a more intuitive clinical measure of A1c variability defined as A1c time-in-range. We will calculate the percentage of days an individual has an A1c level in the appropriate range, based on clinical parameters and the VA-DoD clinical practice guidelines. Objective 3 is to estimate the relationship between A1c variability, % time-in-range, and adverse health outcomes--including micro- and macrovascular complications and mortality. Methods: The project is a retrospective observational study of patient-level administrative and claims data from VA and Medicare. Utilization and pharmacy files will be used to determine patients diagnosed with diabetes between 2004 and 2015. A three-year baseline period will be used to calculate individual A1c variability and a % time in range. The % time in range measure will be the percentage of days an individual has an A1c level in the appropriate range based on VA-DoD Diabetes Clinical Practice Guideline (CPG). Patients will be assigned to the provider that orders the most A1c tests for them during the baseline period and provider A1c variability measures will be calculated. Provider A1c variability will be used as an instrumental variable to predict individual A1c variability, controlling for process quality (objective 1, 2). Residuals will be captured from the equations estimated in these two objectives for objective 3 to measure the effect of individual A1c variability on health outcomes. Significant relationships will then be further validated in a VA-Medicaid population. Findings: All variables required for objective 1 are coded except for the provider process quality measures. Those are in the process of being coded and then these models will be run. A1c variability and time-in-range measures require that veterans be categorized into discreet A1c target ranges based on life expectancy, clinical conditions, and co-morbidities. This is consistent with the recently released VA-DoD Diabetes CPG. We have constructed regression models to predict < 5 and 5-10 years of life expectancy. Top predictors include age, marital status, prescription for sulfonylureas, and specific comorbidities such as liver disease and congestive heart failure. Overall c-statistics were 0.80 and 0.77 respectively, comparing favorably with previously published efforts to predict mortality. Results from this first step will be used to assign veterans to target A1c ranges. Impact: Diabetes is the leading cause of end-stage renal disease, lower extremity amputations and is a significant contributor to myocardial infarction, stroke, and mortality. Effective diabetes management is a policy priority for VHA. There is also a need to develop new quality measures beyond A1c alone to better identify patients at risk for diabetes complications and mortality. A1c variability, as measured by fluctuations in A1c over time, is a potential candidate. Thus, we are developing and validating a new measure of A1c variability--A1c time in range--that will help clinicians and patients control A1c in a way that balances their unique long-term benefits and risks.",1,,,,,,1,,prediction of a1c variability,1
20183102,Self-management among Preteen and adolescent INsulin pump users (SPIN),"For the 1.5 million individuals in the United States living with type 1 diabetes (T1D) the importance of maintaining near normal glycemic control, typically measured by glycosylated hemoglobin (A1C), to prevent microvascular and macrovascular complications is well established. Despite this, most individuals do not meet their glycemic targets, with preteens and adolescents faring far worse than their older and younger counterparts. Insulin pump therapy can improve glycemic control and quality of life; however, unlike younger and older age groups, adolescents show no significant improvement in A1C with insulin pump therapy. Insulin pump therapy is a more physiologic form of insulin delivery than multiple daily injections, yet these complex machines rely heavily on individual proficiency, surveillance, and self-management behaviors to achieve clinical benefit. Suboptimal pump management and unsafe pump behaviors can lead to a decline in glycemic control and adverse events. Research examining insulin pump self-management is limited. The insulin pump download is a valuable objective measure of insulin pump adherence and utilization, yet it remains underutilized in diabetes research. Many insulin pumps have incorporated cloud-based platforms, allowing patient insulin pump data to be directly transferred and stored indefinitely, providing a fertile source of diabetes self-management ""big data."" Identification of key factors affecting insulin pump self-management and hence, glycemic control, is essential for the development of innovative approaches to improve insulin pump self-management. In this proposed mixed method study, we will (1) analyze current insulin pump management behaviors (e.g., frequency of blood glucose testing, insulin bolus frequency, use of bolus calculator, use of advanced features) among 80 preteens and adolescents with T1D by downloading the participants' personal insulin pump; (2) correlate insulin pump download data with measures of glycemic control (e.g., A1C; time in target 70-180mg/dl); and (3) describe the experience of insulin pump self-management, including facilitators and barriers of insulin pump adherence and use, among a subset of preteens/adolescents with good (n=10) and poor (n=10) glycemic control. Bivariate tests, multiple linear regressions, and Poisson regression will be used in our analysis of derived insulin pump self-management variables and glycemic control, adjusting for covariates. Further analyses using big data approaches, including data visualization, will be explored during this research assistantship. The goals of the pre-doctoral research training plan are 1) build expertise of adolescent development and behavior, 2) develop skills in designing and implementing research focused on pre-teen and adolescent chronic disease self-management, 3) develop skills in ""big data"" analysis, and 4) develop skills in grantsmanship and research dissemination. This research training proposal is congruent with the National Institute of Nursing Research's mission to support research that models or improves understanding of self-management behaviors as well as cross-cutting alignment in advancing big data analytics for technology to improve health.",1,1,,,,,,,insulin pump management,1
20164047,A patient-centered framework to test the comparative effectiveness of culturally and contextually appropriate program options for Latinos with diabetes from low-income households,"Background and significance: Diabetes is a national health problem, yet Latinos from low-income households are at greater risk. Although guidelines recommend that patients learn self-management strategies, many are not able to do so effectively and cannot control their diabetes. Studies show that culturally competent self-management programming can help, but patients told us that not all programs sufficiently respect patients' cultural values or account for their socioeconomic limitations. Study aims: This project will compare two models for culturally competent diabetes self-management programming. Our hypothesis is that the program model that best considers patient culture and accommodates patient socioeconomic circumstances will have the best outcomes. Study design: We have designed the research to follow PCORI's scientific requirements. We have completed calculations to make sure that enough people will participate so that our findings will be scientifically meaningful. We will gather data about patients at each of the programs. We made a detailed project timeline with specific accomplishments that include both scientific and engagement activities. We assembled a research team with the expertise and experience in patient-engaged research necessary for the proposed study, and we have support from both our university and our community partners. We also have included many opportunities for paid patient participation. Things we compare: We will compare two diabetes self-management program models used by many Latino patients from low-income households in Albuquerque, New Mexico: 1) the Diabetes Self-Management Support Empowerment Model and 2) the Chronic Care Model. Study population: Our patient advisors told us that gathering data from individuals alone does not account for important social aspects of Latino patients' lives, so we will recruit patients and ask them to invite someone close to them to participate too. Patients will be individuals who consider themselves to be Latino and who are from low-income households. We will recruit 240 patient-caregiver pairs through the two sites. Primary outcome: The primary outcome to be measured is improved capacity for diabetes self-management, measured as diabetes knowledge and patient activation or the ability to put that knowledge into action. Secondary outcome: The secondary outcome to be measured is successful diabetes self-management measured through reduced A1c, body mass index (BMI), and depression. We will also consider two exploratory clinical measures: 1) patient body composition; and 2) patient stress levels, measured using hair samples, to identify levels of cortisol as a biological marker for chronic stress. Methods: We will use statistical calculations to make sure that the things we are comparing are differences in program design and not differences in individual patient characteristics. We will compare whether the programs improve diabetes health knowledge, ability to act, A1c, BMI, body composition, and depression and stress control, and we will determine which program is best.",1,1,1,,,,,,diabetes self management,1
20164097,Statistical methods for phenotype estimation and analysis using electronic health records,"Background and significance: Electronic health records (EHR) provide extensive information on disease risk factors that can be studied to improve our understanding of health outcomes. However, medical assessments are performed at irregular intervals in response to patients' medical needs, which makes these data difficult to use for research. This project will develop new statistical methods that combine the unique set of measures available for each individual to estimate a latent phenotype. The latent phenotype consists of a patient's underlying, true disease profile, which may be only hinted at by the series of medical tests recorded in the EHR. By efficiently combining all available information for each individual, we will leverage the richness and complexity of EHR data, and we will be able to better characterize patients. To demonstrate the potential of our new statistical methods, we will use them to identify children and adolescents with type II diabetes. Using EHR data from eight children's hospital health systems participating in the PEDSnet federation, we will develop a pediatric diabetes latent phenotype. This phenotype can be used in subsequent research for identifying patient participants or for assessing risk of other health outcomes that may be increased in children with type II diabetes. We will work with clinician, patient, and parent partners from PEDSnet to identify downstream health consequences that are most important for further study and analyze associations between the newly developed diabetes latent phenotype and these outcomes. These analyses will illustrate the performance of the latent phenotype approach in a real-world context where information on risk factors and outcomes for type II diabetes is urgently needed. Study aims: The study aims 1) to develop statistical methods for estimating latent phenotypes, 2) to develop methods for incorporating latent phenotypes into analyses of health outcomes accounting for uncertainty in phenotypes and other patient covariates, and 3) to estimate a type II diabetes phenotype for patients in the PEDSnet federation and associations with downstream health outcomes. The long-term objective of this research is to provide better statistical methods for combining inconsistently collected measures derived from the EHR. Study description: We will develop statistical methods and software for estimating latent phenotypes and their associations with health outcomes. We will evaluate the predictive accuracy, bias, and efficiency of these methods relative to standard approaches, through statistical simulations. Using data from PEDSnet, we will estimate a latent type II diabetes phenotype. To assess the added value of using our new methods, we will compare the performance of our new methods with performance of previously developed phenotypes.",1,,,,,,1,,algorithm to estimate latent diabetes phenotypes,1
20173193,Evaluating use of patient-collected audio recorded encounters for provider audit feedback to reduce contextual errors,"Background: Contextualizing care is the process of adapting care plans to patients' individual needs and circumstances. Identifying contextual errors requires listening to an audio recording of the encounter and coding the audio for specific indicators of context and clinicians' attention to them. An extensive program of research on preventing contextual errors culminated in a VISN 12 funded quality improvement initiative that is based on audit and feedback, in which audio recorded data is collected by veterans on provider attention to care planning, analyzed and organized using Content Coding for Contextualization of Care (""4C"") system, and fed back to Patient Aligned Care Teams (PACTs) and clinicians to facilitate continuous quality improvement. Objectives: The study objective is to identify the most efficient, effective, and acceptable data driven strategy for improving contextualization of care in VHA through an implementation and efficacy study of the expansion of an audit and feedback contextualization of care intervention package (""package"") in VISN 12. The study assesses the efficacy of the intervention package at two levels of intensity, the effectiveness of implementation strategies, and the potential of the intervention to pay for itself by reducing unnecessary care. Methods: We are employing an effectiveness-implementation type 2 hybrid design because we have two co-primary aims--optimizing implementation and evaluating the intervention's effectiveness. In addition, we seek to document the costs and cost savings of the intervention package to ascertain its budget impact. The project has added four additional sites to the two currently engaged in the package, two in VISN 12 and two outside. The rollout of the package follows a randomized stepped-wedge design comparing baseline at the four new sites (no intervention) to both a standard and enhanced feedback intervention, with the latter more intensive but more costly. Findings: The successful role out at all six sites, with over 2000 patient-collected audios, the generation of reports based on clinician performance data extracted from the audios, and the engagement of peer clinical champions to share the data with colleagues, demonstrates the feasibility and scalability of the program. A total of 419 anonymous exit surveys of patients indicate comfort with participation, with over 90% indicating that they agree or strongly agree that they ""feel comfortable recording my visit with my doctor."" Over half of participating physicians agree or strongly agree that the program has ""changed how I practice,"" that the feedback provided ""has been valuable to me,"" that the ""potential benefits of the program are clear to me,"" and that I ""feel comfortable having my primary care visits recorded."" Impact: This study will demonstrate the feasibility and scalability of engaging patients in collecting data on the quality of their own care, and assess a quality improvement project to reduce contextual errors, ascertaining, and optimizing its potential to transform veterans' care and to reduce overuse and misuse of medical services.",1,,,,,,1,,identifying contextual errors,1
20171354,Clinical predictive value of systematic reviews with meta-analysis for future research on patients with multiple chronic conditions: a demonstration project using the case of preventive statin therapy,"Background: Patients with multiple chronic conditions (MCC) are the largest consumers of health care in the US. Randomized controlled trials (RCT) of clinical effectiveness have not sufficiently studied these patients, while observational studies inherently produce biased estimates of clinical effectiveness. There are substantial disparities in health and health care for persons with MCC, particularly those with combinations of diabetes mellitus type II (DM), coronary artery disease (CAD), and chronic kidney disease (CKD). The effectiveness of statin therapy for preventing heart attacks and strokes remains unknown in populations with MCC. Furthermore, there is insufficient research done on how to best utilize existing data to study MCC in order to obtain answers that can assist these patients and their clinicians in health care decision making. Objective and specific aim: The objective of this study is to help improve the utility of systematic review with meta-analysis as a method for studying the impact of MCC on clinical effectiveness. The specific aim of this project is to test the predictive value of systematic review with meta-analysis as a method for quantifying the impact of MCC on the clinical effectiveness of statin therapy for preventing heart attacks and strokes in patients with CAD, DM, and CKD. Methods: This study proposes to use systematic review with meta-analysis to identify, select, and critically appraise relevant research studies, to synthesize the data from these studies in an effort to make recommendations for best practice, and to identify gaps in the literature that can lead to better-informed research for patients with MCC. A systematic review will be done to examine the impact of having MCC on the clinical effectiveness of statins for the prevention of heart attacks and strokes. AHRQ guidelines will be implemented to find, assess, and synthesize the evidence from all studies, including both experimental and observational designs, which are relevant to the research question. Data from the included studies will be combined statistically to produce several meta-analyses. Meta-regression, subgroup, sensitivity, and cumulative analyses will be performed to create quantitative measures of the impact of having different combinations of MCC on the effectiveness of statin therapy. Projected outcomes: The primary outcome of this project will be to determine how well systematic review with meta-analysis can help quantify the impact of having MCC on clinical effectiveness. A secondary outcome will be the quantification of this impact for the effectiveness of statin therapy, which represents one of the most widely prescribed treatments in the US. This study's recommendations will guide researchers on how to utilize systematic review with meta-analysis to analyze existing data on patients with other MCC. This will help reduce the need to conduct additional expensive and large experimental or observational studies, thereby rapidly improving clinical decision making and speeding up the implementation of evidence into practice for these populations with special care needs.",1,,,,,,1,,methods - using metas to quantify multiple chronic conditions,1
20172395,Opening the black box of cultural competence,"Background: Ensuring that care is delivered equitably across different veteran populations has been a longstanding VA priority. Cultural competence (CC) training has burgeoned in the last decade throughout the U.S., as a measure to reduce disparities in care delivery, and has been promoted by the VA. However, most CC programs are delivered without a sound evidence base to inform their content. In our prior study--""Measuring Cross-Cultural Competence in VA Primary Care"" (VA HSR&D ECV 04-296)--we found that primary care providers (PCPs) with higher levels of CC, measured using self-administered scales that we previously developed, receive higher ratings of care from minority patients with diabetes, such that there were fewer racial disparities in the quality of care delivered by high CC providers. Objectives: The goals of this project are to 1) understand differences in patient-provider communication among high and low CC PCPs; 2) understand patients' perceptions of their interactions and relationships with high and low CC PCPs and other Patient Aligned Care Team (PACT) members; and 3) understand the contribution of CC among PCPs/PACTs to quality and equity of diabetes care. Methods: We will conduct a mixed-methods study at 4 geographically diverse VA medical centers, recruiting approximately 50 PCPs and PACTs, and a target sample of 5 African American and 5 white patients with diabetes per PACT. We will evaluate self-assessed CC among recruited PCPs and PACT members. We will audio-record visits between each recruited patient and his/her PCP and will quantitatively and qualitatively analyze communication patterns in these visits to understand differences in patient-provider communication among high and low CC PCPs. We will conduct brief surveys with each patient and will interview a subsample of them, to understand patients' perceptions of their interactions and relationships with high and low CC PCPs and PACT members. Finally, we will examine the association of PCP/PACT CC with self-reported and clinical outcomes, to understand the contribution of CC to quality and equity of diabetes care. Findings: None to date. Impact: The purpose of this project is to provide evidence to inform effective CC training, both within and outside the VA. Evidence-based CC training is a priority for the VA, as evidenced by the establishment of the Division of Cultural Competence and Communication, within the VHA's Office of Health Equity (OHE). Our findings will inform national VA efforts to reduce racial and ethnic disparities in care delivery.",1,,1,,,,,,patient-provider communication and cultural competence training,1
20173051,Trial to Examine Text Message for Emergency Department Patients with Diabetes with Family And friend Network Supporters (TExT-MED+FANS),"This is an application for a K23 award for Dr. Elizabeth Burner, an emergency physician and patient-oriented clinical researcher at the University of Southern California. She is developing a research agenda examining novel communication technologies to improve patient self-management of diabetes. This K23 award will provide Dr. Burner with support to (1) become an expert in mixed-methods research strategies, (2) conduct clinical investigations of a mobile phone-based behavioral intervention for urban Latino patients with diabetes that incorporates an augmented social module, (3) conduct sophisticated statistical analysis to examine patient characteristics that impact the intervention's efficacy, and (4) develop an independent clinical research career. Dr. Burner has established a mentoring team led by Dr. Thomas Buchanan with expertise in diabetes and interventions among low-income Latinos and two co-mentors: 1) Dr. Anne Peters, with expertise in clinical trials with patients with diabetes; and 2) Dr. Shinyi Wu, with expertise in health systems, mobile health interventions, and non-English speaking patients. She will also have key advisors in 1) Dr. Sanjay Arora, with expertise in mobile health with emergency department patients; 2) Dr. Lourdes Baezconde-Garbanati, with expertise in qualitative methods and culturally sensitive interventions for Latinos; and 3) Dr. Wendy Mack, with expertise design and statistical analysis of non-cancer clinical trials. Dr. Burner will be taking formal coursework, participating in several research seminars at the University of Southern California, and will conduct a mentored research project. Diabetes has disproportionately affected the Latino population. TExT-MED (Trial to Examine Text Message for Emergency Department Patients with Diabetes) is a locally designed, successful mobile health (mHealth) intervention for low-income Latinos with diabetes. Social support interventions have likewise been successful at improving patient self-efficacy and disease management but are limited in scale due to two key obstacles: 1) requirements of in-person training of family and friends to be supporters and 2) the need to coordinate schedules and physical location between the patient and their supporter. mHealth can overcome these obstacles by allowing supporters to be trained remotely via a mobile platform and by allowing communication between a patient and supporter to occur at any time or place. The proposed intervention leverages the success of TExT-MED by augmenting the program with a social supporter that each patient can select from his or her own social support system (Family And friend Network Supporters [FANS]), creating TExT-MED+FANS. Aim 1 refines and lengthens the preliminary TExT-MED+FANS intervention through focus groups and individual interviews with cognitive interview techniques. Aim 2 conducts a 12-month, randomized pilot study of this intervention. Preliminary data will be collected on change in glycemic control measured by hemoglobin A1c and change in healthy behavior choices measured by multiple validated scales to support a future fully powered trial. Lastly, aim 3 evaluates the user experience with TExT-MED+FANS, and the impact of TExT-MED+FANS on patient motivation, self-efficacy, and behaviors, through a qualitative analysis of semi-structured individual interviews. This research will form the basis for a fully powered study of this mHealth intervention to improve diabetes behaviors and outcomes for a bilingual population.",1,,1,,,,,,social support intervention,1
20173209,Dulce Digital-Me: an adaptive mHealth intervention for underserved Hispanics with diabetes,"Individuals of low socioeconomic (SES) and ethnic minority status, including Hispanics, the largest U.S. ethnic minority group, are disproportionately affected by diabetes. Poor healthcare access and cultural barriers prevent optimal care, adherence, and clinical benefit, thus placing Hispanics at high risk for costly diabetes complications. Our established academic-healthcare-community partnership has unique experience in developing and testing innovative, cost-effective, and sustainable chronic care interventions to reduce disparities and improve health in underserved communities. We recently developed Dulce Digital (i.e., ""one-size-fits-all"" educational text messages, with nurse monitoring of patient-transmitted blood glucose values), which improved glycemic control across 6 months, relative to usual care in a recent randomized controlled trial (RCT) of N=126 Hispanic patients with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes (T2DM). Our process evaluation indicated that Dulce Digital was both feasible and acceptable from patient and provider perspectives; however, patients expressed a preference for a more individualized intervention, and providers requested an even greater focus on health behavior change. Thus, the proposed RCT will examine the comparative effectiveness of Dulce Digital versus ""Dulce Digital-Me"" (DD-Me) in N=414 Hispanic adults of low SES with poorly controlled T2DM from Neighborhood Healthcare, a San Diego federally qualified health center. Guided by patient and provider feedback, DD-Me includes Dulce Digital components plus personalized goal-setting and feedback that is responsive to the individual's needs and preferences. The DD-Me adaptive feedback component will be informed by the Resources and Support for Self-Management Model and Operant Conditioning Theory, and based on the individual's progress on intermediate behavioral targets (i.e., medication adherence assessed by wireless sensor; brief mobile phone-based assessments of diet, physical activity, stress). Feedback will be delivered via algorithm-driven automated messaging in 50% of DD-Me participants and by the care team medical assistant in the remaining half to determine the feasibility and acceptability (given the purported cultural relevance of interpersonal relationships in the Hispanic culture), and the comparative effectiveness and cost of each delivery method. Changes in indicators of diabetes clinical control (i.e., glycosylated hemoglobin [HbA1c], low-density lipoprotein cholesterol [LDL-C], systolic blood pressure [SBP]), patient-provider communication, and patient adherence (i.e., to medication and other diabetes self-management behaviors) will be evaluated across twelve months. Thorough process and cost-effectiveness analyses will evaluate the scalability and sustainability potential of DD-Me. Our comparative evaluation of two mHealth approaches will elucidate how technology can be integrated most effectively and efficiently within existing nurse-led chronic care approaches to meet the complex needs of underserved individuals with poorly controlled T2DM.",1,1,,,,,,,digital intervention,1
20173260,Improving diabetes risk assessment and screening in minority-predominant community health center patients,"Type 2 diabetes disproportionately affects U.S. racial/ethnic minorities, as evidenced by a higher prevalence of the condition and its complications among Hispanics, blacks, Asian Americans, Pacific Islanders, and Native Americans compared to whites. In October 2015, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) released a new recommendation to screen asymptomatic adults who are 40-70 years old and overweight/obese for diabetes and prediabetes (collectively called dysglycemia). These screening criteria are likely to identify proportionately fewer cases of dysglycemia among racial/ethnic minorities, who experience higher risk at younger ages and lower body weights compared to whites. By contrast, the American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommends screening in adults with at least two diabetes risk factors, including non-white race/ethnicity. Screening criteria are based on models that use risk factors to predict the development of dysglycemia. However, existing risk models have limited application in practice because they include data that are not routinely collected, and they do not accurately predict dysglycemia in racial/ethnic minorities. Using data from a national network of community health centers whose patients are predominantly racial/ethnic minorities, this timely research will investigate the assessment of diabetes risk and the effectiveness of alternate screening criteria. The Alliance of Chicago Community Health Services (Alliance) is a national data warehouse for over 200 community health centers, which links sociodemographic, laboratory, and health care utilization data from the electronic health records (EHR) of over 800,000 patients. Using longitudinal Alliance data from 2006 to 2015, we will compare the performance of three different approaches for predicting dysglycemia, based on 1) USPSTF criteria, 2) ADA criteria, and 3) criteria from a novel risk prediction model we will develop using the same EHR data. In a second aim, we will estimate and compare the costs and short-term cost-effectiveness of screening based on the same sets of criteria. This economic analysis is essential to promote the uptake of optimal diabetes screening approaches in practice. Findings from this study can be used to improve diabetes screening recommendations to better identify high-risk individuals, especially racial/ethnic minorities. This study may therefore help reduce racial/ethnic disparities by detecting dysglycemia earlier in these groups, so that prevention and treatment strategies can be initiated. In addition, this study will lead to future research that tests novel interventions for screening, diagnosing, and treating dysglycemia, and examines the long-term cost effectiveness of screening approaches. Our multidisciplinary team has extensive expertise in the content areas and methods needed to successfully conduct the proposed secondary data analysis, and then investigate the application of study findings in practice. This study is timely in its examination of new diabetes screening criteria; novel in its inclusion of a large, minority-predominant patient sample; and significant in its potential to maximize both population health and health equity in diabetes.",1,,,,,,1,,mass diabetes screening,1
20181182,Health disparities in Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment among Mexican Americans,"The long-term goal of this research is to address two important health disparities faced by Mexican Americans suffering from Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI): (1) younger age of onset and (2) decreased access to early detection and treatment. AD is the most common form of neurodegenerative dementia and the fifth-leading cause of death for those over 65 (eighth-leading cause of death for U.S. Hispanics). AD has an annual health care cost that is greater than that of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and cancer. While death rates from CVD and cancer have declined in recent decades, death rates have steadily increased for AD. The Mexican American elderly population is among the fastest growing segments of the population; however, little research on MCI and AD has been conducted among this underserved group. Here we will leverage our ongoing Health & Aging Brain among Latino Elders (HABLE) study to identify different pathways for MCI and AD among Mexican Americans, define subtle neuroanatomical and blood-based biomarker changes that are related to future risk of MCI and AD, as well as provide evidence to support the utility of our AD blood-based detection tool that can be implemented in primary care settings. The current research team consists of leading experts in Mexican American cognitive aging, the epidemiology of MCI and AD as well as biomarkers of MCI and AD (neuroimaging and blood-based). The project will leverage a substantial existing infrastructure and HABLE cohort to address the two health disparities outlined above through the following specific aims: (specific aim 1) examine the impact of higher rates of metabolic burden and depressive symptomatology on MCI and AD among community-dwelling Mexican Americans, (specific aim 2) examine neuroimaging and blood-based biomarkers associated with MCI and AD among Mexican Americans, and (specific aim 3) validate our blood-based AD screening tool as the first-step in a multi-stage diagnostic process among Mexican Americans. The current project will address significant health disparities faced by Mexican American elders suffering from and at risk for MCI and AD. The identification of novel pathways related to disproportionate burden of diabetes and depression can lead to novel ethnic-specific interventions. The identification of a blood-based screening tool for AD will provide primary care providers a way of meeting the needs of a rapidly growing elderly Mexican American population.",1,1,,,,,,,screening for metabolic burden,1
20182623,"Impact of integrated HIV/non-communicable disease (NCD) screening on HIV testing uptake and engagement in HIV care: an RCT in Kisarawe, Tanzania","HIV testing is often shunned in community settings due to the stigma of HIV-centric services. Our recent pilot study strongly suggests that integration of a package of screening that include HIV, diabetes, and hypertension hold promise of substantially increasing the uptake of HIV testing while simultaneously providing direly needed community screening for non-communicable disease (NCDs) like diabetes and hypertension, which themselves are at epidemic levels in Sub-Saharan Africa. In our pilot study we found that HIV testing almost doubled when diabetes and hypertension screening was added. Moreover, once HIV-infected individuals are identified, many are reluctant to enter care due to the stigma of HIV-centric care programs, and over time attrition of clients is a serious problem undermining the clinical and public health benefits of these programs. Our preliminary studies strongly suggest that integration of NCD care within HIV care would increase enrollment and retention in HIV care by destigmatizing the clinics for all attendees, and by providing tangible clinical therapies for the estimated 79% of HIV-infected clients who also have NCDs, especially those waiting to become eligible for ART, who are also those with the highest attrition. We will assess (a) the client characteristics and patterns of utilization at the 6 HIV care and treatment centers (CTCs) in Kisarawe District, Tanzania; (b) trends in HIV testing; (c) history of HIV intervention; (d) census data; and we will (e) conduct community mapping in each CTC's catchment area; (f) consult with community leaders and medical officers; and (g) match two similar CTCs. Next, one of the two CTCs will be randomized as an enhanced intervention site. At both CTCs we will conduct community mobilization to alert the community of available services. At the enhanced intervention CTC, we will also provide screening for diabetes and hypertension. The Health Center (always adjacent to the CTC) will be assisted with treating positive NCD cases. HIV-infected clients will be referred to the CTC at both sites, and the first 89 patients at each CTC will be enrolled in a cohort and followed for 24 months (total N=178 across 2 clinics). Those in the cohort at the enhanced intervention CTC who are NCD positive will have care for NCDs integrated with their HIV care. We will assess how NCD screening affects uptake of HIV testing at the community level over ~18-months. We will establish whether adding NCD care to HIV care improves linkage and enrollment in HIV care. We will determine if retention in HIV care among newly enrolled clients is enhanced over 24 months with the addition of NCD care. We will then cost all intervention components to determine the incremental cost per added client tested for HIV, enrolled in HIV care, and retained in HIV care by adding NCD screening and care.",1,1,,,,,,,HIV plus NCD screening/care intervention,1
20183365,Electronic health record (EHR)-based universal medication schedule to improve adherence to complex regimens,"We will leverage increasingly available technologies to impart a universal medication schedule (UMS) in primary care to help patients living with diabetes safely use and adhere to complex drug regimens. Our research team previously introduced the concept of the UMS to standardize and simplify medication instructions to support safe and effective prescription (Rx) drug use. The UMS standardizes the prescribing and dispensing of medicine by using health literacy principles and more explicit times to describe when to take medicine (morning, noon, evening, bedtime). This eliminates variability found in the way prescriptions are written by physicians and transcribed by pharmacists onto drug bottle labels. We recently tested the UMS in a clinical trial at the point of dispensing medication in pharmacy practice among adults with diabetes. Significant improvement was achieved in proper regimen use and adherence; those who were taking >= 5 Rx drugs and/or were lower literate received the greatest benefit. Yet pharmacy was not the ideal point of implementation, as we learned many patients use multiple pharmacies for cost or convenience, resulting in continued receipt of variable Rx information. Further, findings indicate patients 1) may benefit from direct guidance from their doctor on how to safely consolidate Rx regimens to the most efficient daily schedule and 2) need basic reminders to support memory. In the proposed study, we will impart the UMS at the point of prescribing in primary care using electronic health records (EHRs). As its foundation, our new intervention will standardize prescribing within an EHR so all medication orders include UMS Rx instructions (""sigs"") and patients receive both a medication information sheet and UMS-structured medication list with after-visit summaries. We have already successfully developed and pilot tested these tools (in English and Spanish) within the Epic EHR system. In addition, mobile tools may further improve regimen use. We will link a unidirectional short message service (SMS) text reminder service to the EHR, delivering medication reminders to patients around UMS intervals. We propose to conduct a 3-arm, physician-randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effectiveness of the UMS EHR-based strategy, with and without SMS text reminders, to improve patient understanding, safe use, and adherence compared to usual care. A total of 1200 (n=400 per arm) English- and Spanish-speaking primary care patients living with type 2 diabetes and taking >= 5 Rx drugs will be enrolled from primary care practices in Chicago, IL and New York, NY, with outcomes assessed at baseline, 2 weeks, and 3 and 6 months. We will also determine the fidelity and costs of the interventions to guide future dissemination efforts. Our specific aims are to 1) test the effectiveness of the UMS and UMS + SMS text reminder strategies compared to usual care; 2) determine if the effects of these UMS strategies vary by patients' literacy skills and language; 3) evaluate the fidelity of the two strategies and explore patient, staff, physician, and health system factors influencing the interventions; and 4) assess the costs required to deliver either intervention from a health system perspective.",1,1,,,,,,,universal medication schedule,1
20183384,Self-management of diabetes in black men: the Men Are Now United Program (MANUP),"Significant racial disparities between non-Hispanic blacks and whites exist in the prevalence of diabetes and the story of John Henry, the ""steel-drivin'"" man is well known to most black men in the U.S.; and to most, John Henry is a hero because of his relentless determination. John Henryism is defined as a survival strategy developed among newly freed black people, one that endorsed the values of hard work, self-reliance, and high-effort coping--all attributes of successful chronic disease self-management. The goal of this research is to develop a culturally grounded diabetes self-management intervention for adult black men. Black men are identified as a priority group in need of targeted diabetes self-management interventions. The purpose of this application is to create and implement a targeted, culturally grounded, diabetes self-management intervention for black men with type 2 diabetes that uses social support, mobile health, and remote sensing technology to improve diabetes-related outcomes. The primary outcome will be a 0.5% reduction in A1C levels following the intervention. Secondary outcomes will include reductions in diabetes complication risk factors of blood pressure, waist circumference, and cholesterol. Additional outcomes include medication adherence, blood glucose monitoring, and physical activity. The 10-week intervention is comprised of three components: (1) ten group-based social support meetings that will include the formation of two-man partnerships (""buddies""); (2) a remote-sensing health behavioral technology, the cloud-based Telcare glucometer to facilitate objective monitoring of health behavior; and (3) development of gender-sensitive, culturally grounded text messages designed to motivate and remind participants to engage in recommended self-management behaviors. Year one is devoted to designing the group intervention and developing and testing the set of targeted text messages by drawing upon self-determination theory, the diabetes empowerment approach, and research on John Henryism. Given its broad recognition and endorsement among black men, the story of John Henry and research on John Henryism holds tremendous promise as a conceptual foundation for engaging black men in a health promotion program. Year two will test the 10-week intervention using a wait-listed control (the men will serve as their own control), repeated measures single-arm design (three points in time) with 40 black men. The study also includes a three-month post-intervention follow-up assessment. Pragmatically, we have chosen to focus on behavior that can be influenced by one-to-one partnerships and small groups. As this targeted research program develops, we will incorporate the influence of family systems and neighborhood contexts within which black men operate. In summary, black men with type 2 diabetes can benefit from applying the principles of self-determination, diabetes empowerment, and John Henryism to their own health challenges. The proposed research will develop a gender targeted self-management intervention to assist adult black men in controlling diabetes through social support and mobile health technology.",1,1,1,,,,,,"individual and small group intervention, john henryism",1
20184409,Optimizing lifestyle interventions with mindfulness-based strategies in type 2 diabetes,"Background: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is the most expensive chronic disease in the U.S. Lifestyle modification is central to T2DM management, but long-term adherence to dietary recommendations is difficult. A key challenge is the difficulty of coping with cravings for high carbohydrate or sugar-laden foods in an environment where these foods are tempting and widely available. One mechanism by which mindfulness may increase long-term dietary adherence is by better equipping individuals with skills to experience food cravings and difficult emotions without eating in response. Such approaches seek to strengthen abilities to be non-judgmentally aware of, tolerate, and respond skillfully to food cravings and difficult emotions without reacting impulsively or maladaptively. We hypothesize that improved ability to manage food cravings and emotional eating is a key mechanism through which mindfulness enhancements can improve dietary adherence. We will test mindfulness-based intervention (MBI) components for improving dietary adherence based on our group's recent National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH)-funded trial testing MBI components for obesity, which showed evidence of improved fasting glucose, lipids, and potentially weight. Although the particular diet employed is not the focus of this study, we plan to use a diet with about 10% of calories from carbohydrate as (1) it induces a low level of ketone production, which we will use as a biomarker for dietary adherence; and (2) prior studies suggest it improves metabolic parameters in T2DM, including glycemic control. Methods: We will use ecological momentary assessment (EMA) methods to measure eating in response to difficult emotions and/or food cravings. In the R61 phase, we will ensure this measure is appropriate for further testing and assess the impact of the MBI components on our hypothesized behavioral mechanisms in N=45 persons with T2DM. We plan 3 waves of 15 persons each, with 12 weekly sessions. All participants will attend an in-person group course providing education on basic behavioral strategies for diet and physical activity. Participants will be randomized to receive this education alone (Ed) or this same material with added MBI components (Ed+MBI). We will also pilot test two levels of intensity of maintenance phase intervention (monthly group meetings alone or supplemented by individualized attention) to prepare them for R33 testing. We plan an R33 phase trial in which 120 persons with T2DM will be randomized (using a 1:2 ratio) to Ed or Ed+MBI conditions and followed for 12 months, including a 9-month maintenance phase. We will test the effects of MBI components on our proposed behavioral mechanisms and dietary adherence and obtain preliminary data on MBI component effects on weight and glycemic control. We will use an innovative adaptive intervention design to optimize maintenance phase intensity, which we believe may be key to augment the MBI effects. Significance: Our studies promise to extend our understanding of how MBI components can improve dietary adherence and have broader implications for understanding the mechanisms of MBIs for other conditions such as addiction.",1,1,,,,,,,emotions and food cravings,1
20163146,Improving methods of incorporating racial/ethnic minority patients' treatment preferences into clinical care,"Past attempts at eliciting patient preferences have not taken into account the prior negative experiences of the patient and his or her family and community. This may lead minority patients to prefer different treatment options or no treatment at all. Eliciting preferences without sufficient context may result in treatment plans centered on incomplete preferences information. A mismatch between treatment and patient preferences worsens health outcomes via lower patient engagement, poorer adherence, and higher attrition. We propose to develop a new method that more accurately elicits patient preferences and to apply this method for depression and type II diabetes. The objectives are to leverage the power of a more thorough method that asks patients what matters in treatment and includes patient feedback about prior experiences, and to understand patient and provider perspectives on incorporating preferences questions into clinical care, and how this could help improve treatment plan setting and engagement in care. In aim 1, we develop and test a conceptual model of adaptive patient preferences for depression and type II diabetes. Our preferences elicitation procedure consists of conjoint analysis supplemented with additional survey questions to elicit individual, familial, community, and sociocultural factors that influence patient preferences. In aim 2, in-depth follow-up interviews with survey respondents explore themes generated from the survey. In aim 3, clinicians and health system stakeholders will discuss the results of the preferences elicitation procedure and the feasibility of adapting such procedures when co-developing a treatment plan for depression and diabetes. Understanding patient preferences for care is crucial to understanding and measuring racial/ethnic disparities in treatment for depression and type II diabetes, and is especially important when a clinician and patient jointly develop treatment plans. Stemming from our primary outcome (relative value of treatment options in dollars) and secondary outcome (negative prior patient experiences), our research will yield a patient-centered process for improving preferences elicitation, and guidelines for providers to incorporate additional questions about patient preferences into the joint development of a treatment plan. We will disseminate our methodology and results to facilitate replication for other diseases. Patients and health system stakeholders will be integrally involved in the research team to ensure that the perspective of a diverse community of stakeholders (patients, clinicians, and patient advocates) are incorporated from the onset of the grant period in all three research aims. Patients and providers are also the focus of qualitative interviews that further inform research methodology and results.",1,1,1,,1,,,,"individual, family, and cultural factors influencing patient preferences",1
20171065,Impact of primary care clinician interdependence and coordination on quality of care delivered to complex older patients with diabetes,"A shortage of primary care physicians makes it difficult to deliver quality diabetes care to Americas aging population. A frequently recommended approach to compensate for escalating primary care physician shortages, while still meeting the chronic illness care needs of an aging population, is to incorporate physician assistants (PAs) and nurse practitioners (NPs) into primary care teams. While a number of team models incorporating PA&NPs have delivered quality care to patients with chronic illnesses such as diabetes, data is limited regarding which clinician team approaches are most effective. Identifying effective approaches to incorporating PA&NPs into primary care teams that care for older patients will require identification of effective PA&NP roles, as well as features of PA&NP and physician interaction (interdependence and coordination) that can improve patient outcomes. Interdependence between primary care PA&NPs and physicians occurs when they provide care to, or ""share"" common patients. Managing shared patients between clinicians requires coordination. Coordination can be accomplished through multiple methods, including routines (ex: clinical pathways), boundary spanners (ex: case managers), team meetings (ex: huddles), and relational coordination (i.e., communication and relationships) and is believed to be a key mechanism by which clinician teams will improve patient outcomes, particularly for older, complex patients with multiple chronic conditions. Focus has been placed on improving patient outcomes by coordinating care between settings, such as between specialists and primary care. To our knowledge, however, no studies have evaluated the impact of interdependence and/or coordination within primary care on patient diabetes outcomes such as glycemic and lipid control or development of patient treatment goals. My long-term goal is to improve chronic illness care for older complex patients through identification and implementation of effective primary care teams. In order to develop and evaluate team interventions, it is critical to address the medical and social aspects of team-based care delivery. Designing and evaluating interventions that address both aspects of team care require a range of knowledge and skills, including expertise in mixed-methods research approaches, organizational theory, and implementation science. The objective of this application is to determine if PA&NP and physician interaction (interdependence and coordination) on teams impacts outcomes for older patients with diabetes. My health policy background, clinical experience as a PA, and formal quantitative research training will provide the foundation for the proposed project. I will pursue career development in mixed methods, and implementation science and organizational theory at both Duke University and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC). The specific aims of the proposed project are to describe the methods of coordination utilized between PA&NPs and physicians on primary care teams (aim 1); to evaluate the relationship between the interdependence of PA&NPs and physicians on primary care teams and outcomes (glycemic and lipid control as well as patient treatment goals) for older patients with diabetes (aim 2); and to determine if methods of coordination mediate the relationship between PA&NP role, interdependence, and outcomes for older patients with diabetes (aim 3). To achieve these aims, I propose a mixed-methods approach. I will collaborate with Duke Primary Care to conduct interviews and surveys with health care professionals from Duke's clinics regarding the full range of coordination mechanisms used within their teams and practices (aim 1). This information will be combined with data derived from electronic health records for medically complex patients over the age of 65 with diabetes in order to match PA&NP and physician interactions (aim 2) with patient outcomes (aim 3). Synthesis of aims 1-3 will inform development of a primary care team-based intervention involving clinician interdependence and coordination for an R01 proposal aimed at improving chronic disease management in complex older patients with diabetes. This proposal sets forth essential development steps that are analogous to preclinical/phase 1 studies that are pivotal to guide later successful intervention trials. Skills gained in organizational psychology, mixed methods, and implementation science will complement my prior clinical and research training to position me for success as an independent health services researcher with the skills to design and implement health care teams that improve chronic disease management for complex older patients.",1,,1,,,,,1,care coordination,1

The YALE-TCC proposes a research portfolio that combines different types of data to improve our ability to identify who is at risk for hypertension (HTN) and type 2 diabetes (T2D) sooner than we can now. The YALE-TCC also supports pilot and demonstration projects. Through the coordinated activities of the YALE-TCC, the ultimate goal is to identify and test culturally relevant and low-resource interventions to reduce the population burden of HTN and T2D and to inform clinical care delivery to individual patients at high risk for these diseases and their consequences.",1,1,,,,,,,culturally relevant and low-resource interventions (ambiguous),1
20171334,Postpartum health care utilization following complicated pregnancies: a national population-based study,"Introduction: Gestational diabetes (GD) and hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP), including pre-eclampsia and eclampsia, occur in an estimated 6-8% of pregnancies in the US. Both conditions are known factors that increase a woman's future risk of cardiovascular (CVD) disease. The postpartum period is also an ideal opportunity to provide patient education to this group of women about their risk of developing type 2 diabetes, CVD, and the importance of maintaining a healthy weight, along with further monitoring and treatment. A few population-based and cohort studies have examined postpartum health care utilization among women with pregnancy complications. Less is known about the health care that women receive and use following a pregnancy by GD and HDP, using nationally representative data. Objective: The study objective is to examine the association between pregnancy complications (GD and HDP) and postpartum health care utilization. Methods: The proposed study will use longitudinal pooled panel data from the household component of the 1996-2007 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) with linked data from the Pregnancy Detail Files. Adult women (18+) with singleton pregnancies who had deliveries, and who have non-zero person weights with complete covariate data will be eligible for the analysis. Multivariable logistic regression analyses will be used to examine the associations among pregnancy complications (GD and HDP vs. no complications), ambulatory care use, and receipt of preventive care services (blood pressure, cholesterol, nutrition, physical activity) within the past year of delivery, adjusting for MEPS sampling design and covariates.",1,1,,,,,,,gestational diabetes as the independent variable,1
20173219,Short- and long-term effects of disasters on seniors with chronic conditions,"This project will investigate the short- and long-term effects on health care utilization and health outcomes of elderly diabetics affected by Hurricane Katrina. Over 1.5 million individuals were evacuated from the Gulf Coast due to Katrina and over 600,000 Medicare beneficiaries in Louisiana alone were affected by the storm. Seniors with diabetes were especially vulnerable to Katrina's effects. Those affected were often unable to obtain medications, were forced to rely on replacement medications that didn't necessarily match their needs, had to forgo necessary medical care, and experienced a lack of calories and abrupt diet changes. The analysis will employ individual-level data that identify Medicare beneficiaries with diabetes prior to Katrina in the affected areas and, for comparison purposes, in unaffected areas. The data cover the period 2002-2012, include demographic characteristics, and contain geographic information that will allow for the identification of seniors who were displaced from the affected areas. The data further specify by date the treatment received in outpatient and inpatient settings as well as prescription information. Pre-post analyses will be performed across racial/ethnic groups within affected areas. Further analyses will compare individuals in affected versus unaffected areas utilizing a difference-in-differences econometric approach. The utilization analysis will examine whether there were interruptions in treatment by comparing the data in the period prior to Katrina to the period after landfall. The outcome analysis will investigate comorbidity incidence rates and mortality rates. All of the analysis will explore differences by gender and race. We expect to find that Hurricane Katrina had a significant, extended, and negative effect on seniors with diabetes. Many of these individuals had to forgo their typical treatment regimen and suffered from dramatic departures from their prescribed diet. It is further likely that these disruptions led to increased hospitalization rates due to complications from lack of care. Finally, racial and ethnic disparities are likely present based on differences in socioeconomic status and resources available to devote to health care and well-being. Our study may provide useful information to medical professionals and policymakers. By identifying the magnitude of treatment disruptions and the associated negative health outcomes, we may assist in targeting the best response to treating senior diabetics in future disasters.",1,,,,1,,,1,food and healthcare disrupts because of hurricane katrina,1
20173247,An mHealth intervention to increase activity among patients at risk for type 2 diabetes,"Patients with type two diabetes (T2D) frequently lead sedentary life styles, which is not only a risk factor for diabetes, but can also exacerbate the disease. Recommending increased physical activity is therefore a cornerstone of T2D prevention and management. Historically, increasing activity was synonymous with exercise; however, we now know that even much more modest activity levels (e.g., simply walking) or merely decreasing the proportion of sedentary time may be sufficient to improve health outcomes. Some interventions designed to increase activity have shown promise; others have been less successful. The availability of inexpensive pedometers, and, more recently, low-cost triaxial accelerometers, has now made it much easier to monitor activity levels and provide feedback to users. These devices are ideal for capturing activity associated with walking, the most popular and acceptable form of exercise for patients with T2D, but only if patients actually wear them. Thus, there is a need to develop pragmatic approaches that encourage patients to not only wear these monitoring devices, but also to motivate them to increase their activity. The overarching goal of this proposal is to develop new practical, affordable, and easy-to-use approaches to increase activity among patients at risk for developing T2D and those already diagnosed with T2D. To achieve this goal, we will test MapTrek, an mHealth game of our own design that uses low-cost triaxial accelerometers to encourage patients to walk more, and we will test this mHealth intervention against a control group using the accelerometers alone. The data we generate will help inform a larger pragmatic trial to investigate long-term clinical outcomes and costs.",1,1,,,,,,,mhealth and accelerometry,1
20173252,Comparative effectiveness evaluation of a diabetes case management intervention in American Indians and Alaska Native (AI/AN) communities,"The long-term goal of this project is to address the striking disparities in diabetes and its complications that American Indians and Alaska Natives (AI/ANs) face. To achieve this goal, effective strategies for diabetes management and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk reduction are urgently needed to decrease morbidity and mortality among AI/ANs and to improve their overall health and quality of life. Case management is an important approach to enhance traditional health care delivery for people at elevated risk of adverse outcomes. It holds great promise for alleviating the heavy diabetes and CVD burden among AI/ANs and other minority populations. However, how to effectively implement this intervention in the real-world settings of large and diverse communities remains unclear. The proposed study will comparatively evaluate the effectiveness of the Healthy Heart demonstration project of Special Diabetes Program for Indians (SDPI-HH), a cardiovascular risk reduction project using an intensive case management (ICM) approach. The efficacy of the ICM approach was already well established, thus, SDPI-HH was designed as a translational project without a control group. The effectiveness of the intervention has been evaluated as a pre- and post-test design which, albeit necessary and informative, provides only a partial assessment of the program's ability to manage diabetes and its complications. In this proposal, the SDPI-HH data will be combined with 2 targeted sources, the Indian Health Service (IHS) Diabetes Care and Outcomes Audit data and the data from the Look AHEAD trial, a randomized trial comparing the impacts of an intensive lifestyle intervention (ILI) and diabetes support education (DSE) on cardiovascular outcomes among individuals with diabetes. The specific aims of this project are (1) using IHS Audit data, to broaden the understanding of SDPI-HH effectiveness by comparing the trends of diabetes quality of care between HH and non-HH facilities from 1998 to 2013; and (2) using data from the Look AHEAD trial and employing a propensity score matching approach, to compare the effectiveness of SDPIICM intervention with the Look AHEAD ILI and DSE approaches among patients with diabetes. Our proposed analytic strategy has the potential to reduce or eliminate potential biases present in a one-arm pre- and post-test design that is frequently the only option in community-based translational intervention initiatives. Not only will the resulting findings provide critical guidance as we seek to reduce CVD risks among AI/ANs with diabetes, they will also demonstrate ways in which publicly available public health surveillance and/or historical control data may assist in evaluating similar community-based interventions.",1,1,,,,,,,case management for diabetes treatment,1
20173257,Profiling missing data in electronic health records for diabetes care research,"Current guidelines for diabetes care recommend individualized treatment plans for complex patients since tight control of glycosylated hemoglobin (A1c) may not be appropriate. However, little evidence exists to support patient-centered decisions. Electronic health records (EHRs) provide an important source for clinical evidence on improving diabetes care, but suffer from usability deficiencies. In particular, lab measures and vital signs have intermittent missing values where irregular visit patterns may be informative about patients' underlying medication status. Patient characteristics are also incomplete due to linkage error. We aim to impute missing values in EHRs and improve data quality to strengthen the evidence base for diabetes guidelines. The proposed work is motivated by ongoing clinical research to examine the role of patient complexity in the relationship between tight A1c control and the risk of adverse events, using a pre-existing EHR dataset of 8,304 patients with diabetes cared by UW Health during 2003-2011. We propose Bayesian latent profile models under multiple imputation to account for the potentially non-ignorable visiting process, facilitate modeling a large number of EHR variables of mixed types, and develop scalable computation algorithms. Specifically, first we will build latent profiles by jointly modeling A1c values, patient characteristics, and health outcomes. Second, we will generalize the latent profiles by multiple pattern indices and combine the trajectories of multiple lab measures and vital signs with intermittent missing values, as well as account for incomplete patient sociodemographics. Third, we will release open source computation software and disseminate new clinical findings to the health care delivery system. The investigation results will advance statistical methodology development for missing data in longitudinal studies, increase the compatibility of available patient medical records and strengthen the evidence base to support existing diabetes guidelines.",1,,,,,,1,,identifying latent profiles of diabetes,1
20182042,Short- and long-term outcomes after bariatric therapies in the Medicare population,"Review questions: KQ 1: What are the theorized mechanisms of action of bariatric procedures on weight loss and on type 2 diabetes in the Medicare population? KQ 2: In studies that are applicable to the Medicare population and enroll patients who have undergone bariatric therapy, what are a) the characteristics and indications of patients receiving bariatric therapy including descriptives of age, BMI, and comorbid conditions; b) the characteristics of the interventions, including the bariatric procedures themselves as well as pre- and/or post-surgical surgical work-ups (e.g., psychiatric evaluations, behavioral and nutritional counseling); c) the outcomes that have been measured, including peri-operative (i.e., 90 days or less after bariatric surgery), short-term (2 years or less from surgery), mid-term (more than 2 but 5 or fewer years), and long-term (more than 5 years after surgery) outcomes? KQ 3a: In Medicare-eligible patients, what are the effects of different bariatric therapies (contrasted between them or vs. non-bariatric therapies) on weight outcomes (including failure to achieve at least minimal weight loss)? KQ 3b: What patient- (KQ2a) and intervention-level characteristics (KQ2b) modify the effect of bariatric therapies on weight outcomes (including failure to achieve at least minimal weight loss)? KQ 3c: In Medicare-eligible patients who have undergone bariatric therapy, what is the frequency and the predictors of failing to achieve at least minimal weight loss? KQ 3d: In Medicare-eligible patients who do not achieve weight loss after primary bariatric treatment, what is the effect of revisional bariatric therapies (contrasted between them or vs. non-bariatric therapies) on weight outcomes? KQ 4a: In Medicare-eligible patients, what is the comparative effectiveness of different bariatric interventions (contrasted between them or vs. non-bariatric interventions) with respect to the non-weight loss outcomes in KQ2c and what is the comparative safety of these interventions? KQ 4b: What patient- (KQ2a) and intervention-level (KQ2b) characteristics modify the effects of the bariatric therapies on the outcomes other than weight loss in KQ2c? KQ 5a: In Medicare-eligible patients who have undergone bariatric therapy, what is the association between weight outcomes and eligible short- and long-term outcomes (other than weight outcomes)? KQ 5b: In Medicare-eligible patients, what proportion of the bariatric intervention effect on eligible short- and long-term outcomes (other than weight outcomes) is accounted for by changes in weight outcomes? Searches: We will conduct literature searches of studies in PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, the Cochrane Central Trials Registry (CENTRAL), and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, to identify primary research studies meeting our criteria. These databases should adequately cover the published literature on this topic. The search strategy will be peer-reviewed by an independent, experienced information specialist/librarian. We will send a list of included studies to the Technical Expert Panel and ask them to provide citations of potentially relevant articles that we may have missed. Additionally, we will peruse the reference lists of published clinical practice guidelines, relevant narrative and systematic reviews, and Scientific Information Packages (SIP) from manufacturers or other stakeholders. We will also search ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) for ongoing studies and studies that are not published in the medical literature. In addition, we will search the FDA drugs and devices portals for unpublished data. We will use existing systematic reviews primarily as sources of studies; we will extract and incorporate all studies de novo and will not summarize or incorporate existing systematic reviews, per se. All articles identified through these sources will be screened for eligibility, using the same criteria as was used for articles identified through literature searches. Peer review will provide an additional opportunity for the TEP and other experts in the field to ensure that no key publications have been missed. The search will be updated upon submission of the draft report for peer and public review. All citations found by literature searches and other sources will be independently screened by two researchers. At the start of abstract screening, we will implement a training session, in which all researchers will screen the same articles and conflicts will be discussed. During double-screening, we will resolve conflicts as a group. All screening will be done in the open-source, online software Abstrackr (http://abstrackr.cebm.brown.edu/). All potentially relevant studies will be rescreened in full text to ensure eligibility. Types of study to be included: For all key questions, we will include studies of bariatric therapies as those are defined in the current protocol. Eligible will be any surgical (open or laparoscopic) as well as endoscopic procedure that results in anatomic and/or functional alteration of the gastrointestinal system and which may or may not involve device placement. Studies will be ineligible if they focus exclusively on non-bariatric therapies (i.e., pharmacological, behavioral, nutritional) and studies in which subjects are not candidates for bariatric surgery or have not undergone bariatric surgery. We will also exclude studies on the effects of revisional bariatric surgery as well as studies of the management of bariatric therapy complications (e.g., anastomosis leak, post-surgical hernias, etc.) since these studies address clinical questions that are distinct from the effects of bariatric therapies. Studies reporting on hormonal, biochemical, and other molecular changes in relation to bariatric therapies will be included only if these changes are related to health outcomes. Last, we will exclude cost-effectiveness analyses, case-control studies, case series, case reports, letters, comments, animal studies, and data available only on abstracts. For key question 1, we will focus on biological, pathophysiological, and mechanistic studies. For key question 2, we will include comparative and non-comparative studies (registries, cross-sectional studies, cohort studies). Because key questions 3a, 3b, 3d, 4a, and 4b are about comparative effectiveness and/or safety, only comparative studies, including randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and nonrandomized comparative studies, will be eligible. For key question 3c, we will include prospective cohort studies that report on predictive models for the success or failure of bariatric surgery in regards to weight outcomes. We may also consider only comparative studies in which the information on predictive factors comes only from the intervention arm. For key question 5a, we will include both comparative and non-comparative studies, while for key question 5b we will include randomized and non-randomized comparative studies. The conditions or domains being studied are bariatric surgery interventions. Participants/population are Medicare-eligible population to include those age 65 and older and the disabled. Intervention(s), exposure(s): The interventions are bariatric treatments, including anatomic alteration, FDA-approved device placements, open surgical procedures, as well as laparoscopic and endoscopic procedures: A. surgical bariatric therapies: 1. adjustable gastric banding (AGB); a. LAP-band, pars flaccida technique; b. LAP-band, perigastric technique; c. Swedish-band (also known as REALIZE-band), pars flaccida technique; and d. Swedish-band (also known as REALIZE-band), pars flaccida technique, single bolus filling; 2. gastroplasties: a. horizontal banded gastroplasty, b. vertical banded gastroplasty, and c. endoluminal vertical gastroplasty; 3. sleeve gastrectomy; 4. gastric plication (also referred to as gastric greater curvature plication or gastric imbrication); 5. jejunoileal bypass; 6. biliopancreatic diversion (BPD): a. biliopancreatic diversion (BPD) with RYGB (BPD-RYGB) and b. BPD with duodenal switch (BPD-DS); 7. Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB); 8. mini-gastric bypass; 9. single anastomosis duodeno-ileostomy (SADI); 10. vagal blockade; 11. omentum removal (omentectomy); 12. gastric stimulation (also referred to as gastric pacing); 13. mucosal ablation; and B. endoscopic bariatric therapies: 1. space-occupying endoscopic bariatric therapies: a. intragastric balloons and b. nonballoon devices; 2. aspiration therapy; 3. endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty; 4. endoscopic gastrointestinal bypass devices: a. duodenojejunal bypass sleeve and b. gastroduodenojejunal bypass sleeve; 5. duodenal mucosal resurfacing; 6. self-assembling magnets for endoscopy. Comparator(s)/control: Comparisons of interest include comparisons between different surgical interventions, or between surgical and non-surgical interventions. Primary outcome(s): Outcomes will be classified as peri-operative (i.e., 90 days or less after bariatric surgery), short-term (2 years or less from surgery), mid-term (more than 2 but 5 or less years), and long-term (more than 5 years after surgery). The following outcome categories are of interest: A. mortality; B. weight loss; C. reoperations/need for revisional bariatric surgery; D. postoperative complications, including mortality; E. metabolic/diabetes-related outcomes: i. correction of glucose tolerance, including elimination of all medications with hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) <6; ii. diabetes: new onset diabetes; treatment of diabetes; diabetic complications (microvascular disease, kidney disease, retinopathy); iii. hypoglycemic-like syndromes, such as nesidioblastosis, post-gastric surgery hypoglycemia, and dumping syndrome; and iv. non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and/or non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD); F. reflux; G. cardiovascular outcomes: i. myocardial infraction, ii. stroke, and iii. hypertension; H. respiratory disease: i. asthma and ii. COPD; I. orthopedic outcomes: i. fractures, ii. falls, and iii. osteoporosis/bone-mineral density (DEXA, DEEG); J. sleep apnea including the discontinuation of CPAP or BiPAP; K. incidence of specific cancers (breast, colorectal cancer, endometrial cancer, esophageal adenocarcinoma, gall bladder cancer, and renal cell cancer); L. nutritional deficiencies, including zinc, iron, thiamine, and vitamin D, and associated disorders such as neuropathy and bone disease; M. renal function as measured by creatinine clearance or urinary albumin excretion; N. compliance to follow-up; O. mental health outcomes: i. incidence of suicide and suicide attempts, ii. incidence of depression, iii. alcohol addiction after surgery/substance abuse, iv. psychiatric hospitalizations, v. anxiety, vi. panic disorder, vii. borderline personality disorder, viii. PTSD, and ix. bipolar disorder; P. function and quality of life (validated measurements only), e.g., i. cognitive functioning; ii. sexual functioning; iii. ability to participate in an exercise program; iv. ability to return to work; v. physical performance test pain (joint pain, joint aches); vi. regular daily activities; vii. polypharmacy; and viii. admission to a skilled-nurse facility; Q. access to plastic surgery; and R. readmissions/rehospitalizations. Secondary outcome(s): Primary outcome categories will be weight loss, mortality, type 2 diabetes, quality of life, and ability to perform daily activities. All other outcomes will be secondary. Data extraction (selection and coding): Each study will be extracted by one methodologist. The extraction will be reviewed and confirmed by at least one other experienced methodologist. Any disagreements will be resolved by discussion among the team. Data will be extracted into a customized form in the Systematic Review Data Repository (SRDR) online system (http://srdr.ahrq.gov) designed to capture all elements relevant to the key questions. Upon completion of the review, the SRDR database will be made accessible to the general public (with capacity to read, download, and comment on data). The basic elements and design of the extraction form will be similar to those used for other AHRQ comparative effectiveness reviews and will include elements that address population characteristics, including characteristics of pre- and post-surgical work-ups; descriptions of patients; descriptions of the interventions, exposures, outcomes, and comparators analyzed; outcome definitions; effect modifiers; enrolled and analyzed sample sizes; study design features; funding source; results; and risk of bias questions. Risk of bias (quality) assessment: We will assess the methodological quality of each study based on predefined criteria. For RCTs, we will use the Cochrane risk of bias tool, which asks about risk of selection bias, performance bias, detection bias, attrition bias, reporting bias, and other potential biases. For observational studies, we will use relevant questions from the Newcastle Ottawa Scale. Quality/risk of bias issues pertinent to specific outcomes within a study will be noted and considered when determining the overall strength of evidence for conclusions related to those outcomes. To assess the number of unpublished articles, we will record the number of studies found through the ClinicalTrials.gov search that are completed but unpublished. Strategy for data synthesis: All included studies will be summarized in narrative form and in summary tables that tabulate the important features of the study populations, design, intervention, outcomes, and results. These include descriptions of the study design, sample size, populations, interventions, follow-up duration, outcomes, results, funding source, and study quality. We will include studies found in ClinicalTrials.gov and studies submitted to the FDA whose reports are publicly accessible that give results but do not have a published report. For KQ 1, we will conduct a narrative review by searching editorials, published narrative and systematic reviews in specialty journals, and textbooks in relevant medical specialties. Because the interest is in Medicare-eligible individuals, inferences will be primarily made from studies whose population resembles Medicare beneficiaries. However, because studies that are conducted exclusively in older individuals are uncommon, our synthesis will involve a two-phase approach. In the first phase, we will build an evidence map based on our inclusion/exclusion criteria to describe the categories of studied outcomes regardless of the age distribution of the studied population. In the second phase, we will conduct quantitative analyses for those outcomes for which two or more studies are available with a mean and/or median age of 55 years or above. An evidence map aims to summarize the extent and distribution of evidence in a broad clinical area. A systematic and replicable, but non-exhaustive, methodology is employed to efficiently appraise the available evidence on a topic of interest as well as identify major knowledge gaps. The goal is to provide stakeholders with information about the type and amount of research available, the characteristics of that research, and the topics where a sufficient amount of evidence has accumulated for synthesis. Evidence mapping can inform users of the current state of research findings that could be used to generate hypotheses, inform ongoing research, and identify research gaps. Descriptive analyses for KQ2 will be done at the outcome-category level, and not for each individual outcome. For example, we will describe studies reporting ""orthopedic outcomes"" all together, instead of separately describing studies reporting outcomes such as fractures (e.g., of the knee, hip, spine), need for joint replacement surgery (knee or hip), or falls. To address KQ 3a, 3d, and 4a we will conduct quantitative syntheses for all primary outcome categories and for those secondary outcome categories for which at least 4 studies are available based on the evidence map. We expect to conduct random-effects model meta-analyses of comparative studies, if they are sufficiently similar in population, interventions, and outcomes. Specific methods and metrics (summary measures) to be meta-analyzed will depend on available, reported study data, but we expect to summarize odds ratios for categorical outcomes; hazard ratios for time-to-event analyses; and standardized mean differences for continuous outcomes. Possible reasons for statistical heterogeneity will be explored qualitatively and, if appropriate data are available, we may also conduct meta-regression analyses to evaluate study, patient, and intervention features (e.g., open, laparoscopic procedure, or endoscopic). We will explore subgroup differences within (and possibly across) studies. We also plan to conduct a network meta-analysis to compare all treatment alternatives across studies. We will analyze networks of interventions defined at different degrees of granularity corresponding to different levels of the hierarchical description of interventions in PICOTS. We anticipate conducting a series of subgroup analyses by including in our syntheses only procedures that are contemporary, procedures that have been approved by the FDA, or procedures that are implemented in the U.S. clinical practice. For key question 3b and 4b, we will examine heterogeneity of treatment effects for the patient- and intervention-level characteristics in key questions 2a and 2b through meta-regression and subgroup analyses. For key question 3c, we will identify studies that develop and/or validate predictive models for the change in weight outcomes before and after bariatric surgery. We will summarize the variables used as predictors of treatment effects, the populations in which the models have been developed, whether any validation attempts have been undertaken, and metrics of models' performance (e.g., calibration, discrimination etc.). For key question 5a, we will synthesize the metrics of association between weight loss and short- or long-term outcomes. Specific methodology will depend upon the available studies and the reported data. For key question 5b, we will summarize mediation analyses to estimate the proportion of the bariatric surgical effect on outcomes other than weight loss that is accounted for by weight loss (indirect treatment effect). Analysis of subgroups or subsets: None is planned.",1,1,,,,,,,compartaive effectiveness of bariatric interventions,1
20171229,Developing methods to improve systematic reviews using clinical trial registries,"Systematic reviews are a critical information source supporting policy and clinical decision making, and are expected to provide a comprehensive, current, and unbiased assessment of what is known about a clinical intervention. Traditional systematic reviews are resource-intensive endeavors, and with the rapid and increasing pace of evidence production, it is becoming increasingly difficult to ensure that systematic reviews are kept up to date. While innovations addressing this challenge have previously focused on automating the specific tasks such as screening and data extraction, innovative approaches are now needed that leverage new data sources and consider efficiencies across sets of reviews. This proposal uses a unique resource--ClinicalTrials.gov--as a data source to develop tools that automatically identify relevant clinical trials, track them as they are completed and reported, and signal when a systematic review requires updating. We propose to investigate a corpus of systematic reviews related to interventions targeting obesity and type 2 diabetes to address the two following aims: (1) to develop and evaluate graph-based semi-supervised learning methods for identifying and linking relevant clinical trials from ClinicalTrials.gov to systematic reviews, and (2) to create and populate a dynamically updated database of systematic reviews with data that reflects the most up-to-date view of emerging trial evidence. We will make the tools and database developed in this proposal freely available for use by the systematic review community. Thus, our work will not only introduce new ways to identify relevant evidence, but will also provide an ongoing resource to support systematic reviewers in prioritizing systematic review updates and ensuring that reviews are a comprehensive and timely summary of the scientific evidence.",1,,,,,,1,,systematic review methods,1
20172079,Effectiveness of gastric sleeve vs. gastric bypass for cardiovascular disease,"Bariatric surgery is currently the most effective treatment strategy for weight loss in the severely obese. Long-term data on the ""gold standard"" bariatric operation, Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB), indicate both durable weight loss and a high rate of remission of diabetes after surgery. Recently, vertical sleeve gastrectomy (VSG) has emerged as the most frequently performed bariatric procedure in the U.S. Despite its common use, patients and physicians do not have sufficient, high-quality comparative effectiveness data for VSG to adequately inform treatment decisions between VSG and the gold standard RYGB. Large-scale comparative effectiveness studies, using real-world clinical populations, are urgently needed to fully understand and improve these decisions. We have designed such a study to compare the effectiveness of VSG and RYGB for surgical safety and hypertension, dyslipidemia, and diabetes remission as well as overall CVD risk reduction in 16,693 VSG and 9,943 RYGB patients. This sample size is over 6 times that of VSG patients and over twice the RYGB patients in all published studies directly comparing the effectiveness of VSG and RYGB. No other studies in the published literature have the diversity of bariatric surgery patients that our sample has; 55% are Hispanic or non-Hispanic black. We will apply innovative econometric techniques to address confounding in observational data and study heterogeneity of treatment effects to inform clinical knowledge and identify areas where further randomized studies are needed. We have assembled an experienced, interdisciplinary econometric, health services, and clinical research team to address the following specific aims over a median three years of follow-up: (aim 1) compare the effectiveness of VSG and RYGB in remission of CVD risk factors and reduction in overall CVD risk using advanced statistical and econometric techniques; (aim 2) compare VSG and RYGB surgical safety using similar methods to aim 1; and (aim 3) understand the treatment effect heterogeneity in remission of CVD risk factors, reduction in overall CVD risk, and safety outcomes for patients with different racial/ethnic backgrounds, sexes, and disease burdens at the time of surgery. With the accomplishment of these aims, we will be able to provide population-based, comprehensive, rigorous evidence for clinical and policy decision making regarding the choice between RYGB and VSG for overall CVD risk reduction, risk factor remission, and safety.",1,1,,,,,,,bariatric surgery,1
20172114,"Comparison of the Cardiovascular Benefits of Resistance, Aerobic, and Combined Exercise (Cardio-RACE)","Aerobic exercise (AE) has well-documented health benefits to prevent cardiovascular diseases (CVD) such as heart diseases or stroke. However, there is very little evidence whether resistance exercise (RE) prevents CVD or modifies the development of CVD risk factors, independent of and combined with AE. In fact, the Federal Physical Activity Guidelines primarily focus on AE for health. There remains an important unanswered question: What type or combination of exercise is most effective for CVD prevention? To answer this question, the goal of this study, ""Comparison of the Cardiovascular Benefits of Resistance, Aerobic, and Combined Exercise (Cardio-RACE)"" is to test the hypothesis that RE and AE have independent CVD benefits, thus the combined RE plus AE have greater additive benefits than either RE or AE alone. To achieve this goal, the project includes two specific aims: (aim 1) to explore the comparative effectiveness of RE, AE, and combined exercise on incident CVD risk factors (hypertension, type 2 diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, and obesity) and CVD morbidity and mortality by analyzing a large cohort data; and (aim 2) to evaluate the independent and additive (combined) effects of RE and AE training on traditional and emerging CVD risk factors/markers (central hemodynamics, inflammatory biomarkers, glucose metabolism, blood lipids, adiposity, sarcopenic indices, and fitness) by conducting a randomized controlled trial of exercise. In aim 1, the Aerobics Center Longitudinal Study data in >34,000 adults will be used. This is the largest cohort followed over 35 years with RE and objectively measured muscular strength. In aim 2, 400 adults at high risk of developing CVD will be recruited and randomized to one of four 1-year intervention groups: 1) RE training only, 2) AE training only, 3) a combined RE plus AE training, or 4) no training control. The proposed project will investigate mechanisms of how RE and AE training modify traditional and emerging CVD risk factors/markers (aim 2) and further prevent CVD morbidity and mortality in the general population (aim 1). This study could fill an important gap in our knowledge of the benefits of RE to further prevent CVD, beyond the well-documented benefits of AE. This project potentially contributes to developing more effective clinical and public health strategies to prevent CVD and advancing more comprehensive future physical activity guidelines to support the mission of the National Institutes of Health.",1,1,,,,,,,aerobic and resistance exercise interventions,1

Control of diabetes can be achieved through adherence to diet, exercise, and treatment guidelines, but compliance with prescribed regimens can be complicated and difficult. The Look AHEAD study randomized an intensive lifestyle intervention focused on weight reduction among over 5,000 patients with type 2 diabetes in 2001. Participants in the intervention lost weight and improved their diabetes control over the 11 years of the intervention relative to the control group. Weight reductions and improvements in diabetes outcomes may lead to broader benefits for patients in terms of functional status, ability to work, and fewer health complications. We propose research linking Look AHEAD participants with data from Medicare and the Social Security Administration to determine the effect of the intervention on long-term health care utilization (e.g., hospital admissions), employment, earnings, retirement, and severe disability (as measured by enrollment in disability insurance). In addition, we will simulate the long-term fiscal impacts of a broader, national expansion of the intensive lifestyle intervention. Finally, we will compare health and disability measures collected by the Look AHEAD study to overlapping measures in Medicare and the Social Security Administration data, to evaluate the use of administrative data as a source of health information in clinical trials. The results of this study will provide important evidence on the broader benefits of successful lifestyle interventions for diabetes. In addition, the results will indicate the impact of improved diabetes control on functional status and economic outcomes.",1,1,,,,,,,lifestyle intervention  ,1
20173130,MHealth for diabetes adherence support,"Many African Americans and Latinos with diabetes do not achieve recommended diabetes goals, placing them at high risk for complications. Team-based models of care can help in reaching goals of therapy. Additionally, mobile health (mHealth) technologies can further improve outcomes among those more difficult to reach. This study will evaluate the impact of a team-based, mHealth intervention designed to improve medication adherence, healthy eating, and physical activity behaviors. We will compare this mHealth approach with usual care. Clinical pharmacists and health coaches (HC) will deliver our proposed team-based intervention. MHealth delivery includes mobile phone text messaging, secure videoconferencing, and HC home visits. Pharmacists will focus on medication reconciliation and adherence. Health coaches will help identify psychosocial and environmental challenges to adherence in a culturally sensitive manner. Together, they can assist in goal setting, problem solving, and negotiation of competing priorities, and provide social support leveraging mHealth technologies. Preliminary data from our research group supports the role of health coaches partnering with clinic-based pharmacists in improving diabetes outcomes in minorities. In the proposed mHealth intervention, patient-pharmacist videoconferencing will eliminate the need for in-person visits with a pharmacist, which is impractical for many low-income patients. In addition, our pilot work suggests that text messaging is a preferable means of communication and may facilitate more frequent contact with patients. We propose a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effectiveness of an mHealth diabetes adherence support intervention delivered by clinical pharmacists and health coaches. We will randomize 220 patients through UI Health to either (1) mHealth diabetes adherence support through clinical pharmacists and health coaches or (2) usual care. After one year, patients completing the mHealth intervention will be monitored for an additional year while the usual care group receives the mHealth approach. Outcomes include medication adherence, hemoglobin A1c, blood pressure, and LDL-cholesterol levels. The specific aims include (1) evaluate the effectiveness of an mHealth diabetes adherence support intervention delivered by clinical pharmacists and health coaches to African American and Latino adults with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes; (2) evaluate the maintenance of improved diabetes behaviors as well as clinical outcomes one year after completing the intervention; (3) evaluate the cost and cost-effectiveness of mHealth diabetes adherence support compared to usual care; and (4) evaluate the reach, adoption, and implementation of mHealth diabetes adherence support based on the RE-AIM framework.",1,,1,,,,,,team-based intervention with mhealth,1
20173146,Enhancing evidence-based diabetes control among local health departments,"Background: Nearly 26 million people in the US--or 8.3% of the population--has diabetes. Premature death and disability can be prevented for persons with diabetes through implementation of evidence-based programs and policies (EBPPs). Local health departments (LHDs) are uniquely positioned to implement diabetes control EBPPs because of their knowledge of, and focus on, community-level needs, contexts, and resources. There is a significant gap, however, between known diabetes control EBPPs and actual diabetes control activities conducted by LHDs. Goal: This proposal seeks to reduce the burden of diabetes by increasing adoption of EBPPs among LHD practitioners. Methods: This is a two-phase study that takes a comprehensive approach to elucidate effective tactics for dissemination and implementation (D&I) of EBPPs among LHD practitioners. Phase 1: We will refine and test measures to assess the adoption of EBPPs in LHDs, building on pilot work. Phase 2: We will conduct a qualitative needs assessment of 15 LHDs in Missouri to understand factors influencing the adoption of diabetes control EBPPs. We will then conduct a pre/post, experimental (group-randomized) study of 30 LHDs in Missouri to evaluate the effectiveness of active D&I approaches. The intervention arm of this study (15 LHDs) will receive a flexible ""menu"" of D&I approaches that account for local contextual and organizational factors. The control arm (15 LHDs) will receive a minimal ""usual care"" intervention. We will conduct multivariate regression analyses to model the factors important to improving adoption of diabetes control EBPPs, and will conduct social network analysis to understand the relationships and contextual issues that influence EBPP adoption. We will translate and disseminate findings from phases 1 and 2 to LHD practitioners and practice-related stakeholders in order to support the sustainable practice of diabetes control among LHDs. Innovations and impact: This study is innovative and impactful because it will 1) be the first to identify effective approaches for increasing the adoption of diabetes control EBPPs among LHDs in the US; 2) be the first to develop valid and reliable objective measures of EBPP adoption levels in LHDs; 3) augment diffusion of innovation theory with constructs from institutional theory; 4) include tactics novel to US public health practice (e.g., use of knowledge brokers); 5) use social network analysis and qualitative needs assessment together with traditional statistical modeling for a comprehensive understanding of the predictors of EBPP adoption; and 6) use a stakeholder-driven, flexible ""menu"" approach from which to select a set of D&I activities that have the greatest salience and feasibility among the LHDs enrolled in our D&I trial. This research is expected to result in a replicable D&I model that can significantly impact diabetes and chronic disease control among LHDs.",1,,,1,,,,,adoption of EBPPs in LHDs,1
20173383,"Population health impact of a self-insured employer's policy change to cover weight reduction and diabetes prevention interventions for employees, dependents, and retirees with prediabetes","In September 2015, the University of Michigan (U of M) changed its health care benefits to cover interventions for weight reduction and diabetes prevention at no out-of-pocket cost for the ~20,000 overweight or obese employees, dependents, and retirees with prediabetes among its ~85,000 employees, dependents, and retirees. We will evaluate the impact of this large-scale policy change on population health by first comparing the yield of four strategies being used to identify nondiabetic employees, dependents, and retirees with prediabetes. These strategies include using claims, HbA1c, and BMI levels available in the U of M's self-funded health insurance database to identify prediabetic individuals; applying a validated screening algorithm to the same database to identify additional nondiabetic individuals >=40 years of age at highest risk for prediabetes for HbA1c testing; by asking individuals to self-screen for prediabetes using the CDC Prediabetes Screening Test (and to have HbA1c testing if positive); and by performing prediabetes screening and HbA1c testing as part of a worksite wellness program. We will also evaluate the incremental benefits of tailored feedback, engaging primary care physicians in case finding, and financial incentives for member participation in screening. Second, we will describe intervention uptake and reach and assess individual preferences for in-person and internet-based lifestyle interventions and for metformin therapy. We will attempt to explain intervention participation based on the health belief model, and further describe and compare the uptake, adherence, retention, and change in outcomes (weight, BMI, HbA1c, and quality of life) associated with each intervention. We will also assess the impact of the interventions on population health. Finally, we will model the effectiveness, costs, and cost-utility of the interventions relative to no intervention over one and two years and over simulated 5- and 10-year time horizons using a validated computer simulation model. The rigorous evaluation of this large-scale change in obesity policy will involve collaboration among the research group, patients, providers, provider groups, intervention providers, the U of M, and its health insurer. The results of the evaluation will advance scientific knowledge and will have major implications for benefit design, health policy, and population health.",1,,1,1,,,,,change in insurance benefits,1
20183353,Development and pilot of a strengths-based behavioral mHealth intervention to promote resilience in adolescents with type 1 diabetes,"Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is among the most common chronic conditions of childhood and its management is complex and relentless. Adolescents have increased risk for worsening glycemic control, putting them at risk for short- and long-term complications. As responsibility for daily T1D management tasks begins to shift from parents to youth, supportive parent-adolescent teamwork promotes optimal diabetes outcomes. However, adolescents' cognitive development, desire for autonomy, and changing family and social relationships can make adherence to treatment recommendations difficult and strain attempts at parent-adolescent teamwork. We aim to develop and pilot test a mobile app-based behavioral intervention to facilitate positive, supportive parent-adolescent interactions around T1D management. The proposed study has two parts. First, we plan to involve adolescents with T1D (age 12-17), their parents, and diabetes care providers in designing a smartphone app that supports parents to recognize, keep track of, and reinforce their adolescents for specific positive T1D-related behaviors, or strengths. Example strengths include asking for help with complicated diabetes tasks, talking to friends about diabetes, and expressing confidence or optimism about T1D management. Intermittently throughout the day, the app will push parents a prompt to report which positive T1D behaviors their adolescent has engaged in. The app will generate weekly summary reports of each adolescent's most frequent strength behaviors, and parents will be reminded via the app to praise their adolescent for those patterns. Second, we plan to pilot test this intervention with 82 families; parents will be randomized to an intervention or a control condition. Participants in the intervention condition will use the app for 6 months and provide feedback, and control participants will receive usual care and will not use the app. Our main goal is to determine how often and in what ways families use the app, whether they like it, and to obtain suggestions for improvement. We will also evaluate trends for impact on important diabetes outcomes, such as quality of parent-adolescent relationships, T1D treatment adherence, and glycemic control. Data--including questionnaires, adherence data from blood glucose meters, and glycemic control biomarkers from a blood draw--will be collected at baseline and again 3 and 6 months later. The results of this pilot study will help refine the intervention so that it can be evaluated in a full-scale randomized controlled trial. Ultimately, the goal of this research is to validate brief, convenient, and helpful tools that families of all adolescents with T1D can use to strengthen positive family teamwork and ultimately promote optimal diabetes health outcomes.",1,1,1,,,,,,family and mobile app intervention,1
20164046,Using multifamily groups to improve family-centered self-management of type 2 diabetes among Mexican Americans,"This R01 grant proposal is a response to PA-14-112 ""A Family-Centered Self-Management of Chronic Conditions."" The project (a) evaluates four culturally adapted, family-based treatments designed to improve health status, self-management behaviors and self-efficacy among Mexican Americans with type 2 diabetes using a sequential, multiple assignment randomized trial in a public health setting; and (b) tests hypotheses about the applicability of Ryan and Sawin's individual and family self-management theory, the conceptual foundation for the intervention's key constructs, to the study of diabetes self-management in this population. This conceptual model was selected for study because its emphasis on the integration of family members as partners in care while promoting illness self-management is highly germane to the study population and to the proposed intervention. Spanish speaking, Mexican American patients with type 2 diabetes and their families will be recruited from a primary care clinic affiliated with a large, urban public hospital located in a predominantly Mexican American area of Los Angeles. In the first phase of the study, subjects will be randomly assigned to six 2.5 hour sessions (three months) of either 1) Tomando Control de su Diabetes (TC), a culturally tailored, community-based, diabetes self-management program delivered in a group format by community health workers (promotoras) working with individual patients and families; or 2) TC delivered by health professionals (licensed nurses). Evaluations will be made at baseline, three months, six months and 12 months. After six weeks of treatment (at the midway point of the intervention), subjects will be assessed for improvement in diabetes self-management behaviors (the primary outcome). In the second phase of the study, those subjects who have improved their diabetes self-management behaviors by 50% over baseline will be continued in their assigned treatment for the duration of three months. Those subjects who do not meet this target will be re-randomized to receive either 1) an augmented version of TC that has a specific focus on engaging family members; or 2) a multifamily group treatment led by nurses specially trained in teaching diabetes self-management skills for an additional three months. Subjects will be assessed on setting and adhering to self-management goals related to diabetes; self-management behaviors including adhering to the ADA diet, engaging in exercise activities, monitoring glucose levels, and taking prescribed hypoglycemic medications; diabetes self-efficacy; and hemoglobin A1c levels. Family members will be assessed during these same time frames to determine their knowledge of diabetes care; levels of collaborative goal setting with their ill relative and the health care provider; and levels of family support. The results will advance the understanding of the factors that affect self-management for Mexican Americans with type 2 diabetes, and will provide valuable information towards constructing an adaptive intervention that will help to determine which treatment strategies work to improve diabetes self-management behaviors most efficiently and for whom.",1,,1,,,,,,"family-based diabetse treatments, some delivered by health workers",1
20164069,From episodic to real-time care in diabetes self-management,"Self-management is integral to control of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Effective self-management, however, requires real-time information on health status and behaviors and ongoing health professional facilitation of patients as they monitor and perform self-management. Accurate, timely information for these activities is notably absent from the current health care system. Providing real-time data would help patients and their care providers better understand illness dynamics, develop adaptive approaches to improve health outcomes, and deliver personalized care when and where it is most needed. Emerging mobile health technologies may facilitate adaptive self-management by patients with diabetes by capturing diabetes-related data and providing feedback to patients directly. Sharing these data in real time with the patient and health care provider can foster collaborative work and change care delivery from infrequent episodic care delivery to real-time care at the point in time when patients need it most. However, to date we have little knowledge of how to support patients to use data from mobile technologies for real-time care and do not know how long patients will track multiple types of diabetes-related data. Moreover, we do not know what strategies will best help patients overcome self-management challenges using self-generated diabetes-related data or how providers might most effectively guide patients to better self-manage in real-time. We propose a mixed-methods exploratory study of 50 patients from a primary care clinic with a diagnosis of T2DM; they will be asked to track relevant clinical data over 6 months using a wireless body scale, phone-tethered glucometer, a wrist-worn accelerometer (i.e., Fitbit), and a medication adherence text message survey. Data generated from the devices will be plotted as trajectories that will help us to understand the adaptive challenges that patients face in self-management. A subset of patients will be interviewed at monthly intervals over the 6 months to discuss their adaptive challenges and successes in diabetes self-management. Following the 6-month data collection period, we will conduct focus groups with providers to explore ways to address collaborative work to self-manage diabetes using self-monitoring data, and meet real-time challenges in diabetes self-management.",1,1,,,,,,,mobile self management intervention,1
20171016,CloudConnect: consumer health IT for enhanced treatment of chronic illness,"The purpose of this study is to develop and assess a new approach to self-management that recognizes that many patients with chronic conditions must manage their condition continuously and often do so within a social context. As care shifts to home- and community-based settings, multiple forms of consumer health information technology (IT) are being developed to support patients with their self-management responsibilities. In particular, remote monitoring systems--in which clinically relevant data are captured, analyzed, and converted into medically relevant information--carry potential for use in multiple chronic diseases that require constant oversight. Furthermore, consumer health IT is being advanced that is responsive to the fact that self-management rarely occurs in isolation; rather, patients often rely on others including a primary informal caregiver. Therefore, there is a need to create and evaluate approaches to self-management that integrate consumer health IT interventions facilitating continuous monitoring and both individual and group decision making. This proposal seeks to refine and assess such an approach to self-management, called CloudConnect, with two specific aims: 1) explicate patient and informal caregiver needs and preferences relevant to the technology core of this self-management approach, and 2) evaluate the impact of this self-management approach on engagement and clinical outcomes. The proposed research addresses questions that relate to the design and performance of a self-management approach for type 1 diabetes that integrates remote monitoring of both physiological parameters and patient-generated data, informatic processing of multiple data types to assess near-term risk of adverse events, computation of risk profiles that identify linkages between behavior and self-treatment outcomes, clinical decision support, and health information communication systems, all with a focus on dyads of adolescent patients and their local caregivers. The first of two studies associated with this proposal is a needs assessment study that reveals patients' and primary informal caregivers' needs/preferences for the technology core of CloudConnect. The second study is a randomized control trial that assesses CloudConnect in terms of patient engagement, dyad engagement, and clinical outcomes as well as the relationships among these outcome measures for adolescents with diabetes. The results of this project will inform the design information technology that improves engagement and clinical outcomes for patients who require continuous monitoring and who engage an informal primary caregiver in self-management outside clinical settings.",1,1,1,,,,,,cloud based self management for adolescents and caregivers,1
20162148,Improving self-care decisions of medically underserved African Americans with uncontrolled diabetes: effectiveness of patient-driven text messaging versus health coaching,"The goal of this study is to compare how well motivational messages (text messages from the doctor's office), diabetes wellness coaches, and usual care with diabetes education materials provided at the doctor's office work to help African American adults with uncontrolled diabetes improve diabetes self-care decisions. Self-care is difficult when one has diabetes. But it becomes especially difficult when the diabetes is uncontrolled, the person has other medical conditions, and lives in an area without many primary care doctors. Many studies have shown that encouraging text messages from the doctor's office and health coaches can help people take better care of themselves. But before primary care clinics around the country start sending texts, hiring health coaches, or providing additional educational materials, it is critical for them to know which one is more likely to help. This study will assign African American diabetics to either motivational messages, diabetes wellness coaches, or usual care with diabetes educational materials. We especially want to find out if one works better for people at highest risk, like people who can't read medical information well, people who are very ill, people with depression, people who don't have smartphones, or older adults. We also want to know if one works better for people who live in the city versus people who live in the country. Lastly, we want to find out if messages or coaches help people improve their blood sugar, quality of life, and their feelings about primary care. The study will test motivational messages, diabetes wellness coaches, and usual care with diabetes educational materials side by side in primary care doctors' offices. The messaging and coaching programs will give patients the same information, but in different ways. The motivational messages will come from the doctor's office as text messages to the patient's mobile phone. The messages will be written carefully based on each patient's needs and interests, to give people support with reaching their goals for healthy eating, physical activity, and medication taking. The diabetes wellness coaches will be trained in how to help people get motivated. They will meet with people about once a month to give people support with reaching their goals for healthy eating, physical activity, and medication taking. This study will include 1,000 African American adults, ages 35 to 75, with uncontrolled diabetes and one or more additional chronic condition, living in medically underserved communities in the mid-South. People will have to have a cell phone or smart phone with texting capability to participate. Forty percent of participants will get messages, 40 percent will get coaches for one year, and 20 percent will receive usual care with diabetes educational materials. We will be able to tell whether messages and coaches work by seeing if people improve their diabetes self-care decisions, and if their blood sugar, quality of life, and feelings about primary care get better. Our long-term goal is to get primary care clinics nationally to start using motivational messages or diabetes wellness coaches if they work well.",1,1,1,,,,,,text messages and wellness coaches,1
20171308,Electronic medication adherence reporting and feedback during care transitions,"Adverse drug events are common during transitions from the hospital to the ambulatory setting, in part due to unintentional discrepancies in medication regimens and non-adherence with those regimes. The broad, long-term objectives of this research are to design, implement, and evaluate novel interventions to improve medication safety during transitions of care. The specific aims of the study are to 1) implement a smart pill-box intervention for patients discharged from the hospital to the community; 2) evaluate the effects of the intervention on post-discharge medication discrepancies, medication adherence, and chronic disease management; and 3) determine barriers and facilitators of implementation of the intervention. The design of this study is a cluster-randomized controlled trial, with clustering at the level of the primary care practice. Subjects will include randomly selected patients admitted to the medicine service of a large, urban hospital on 5 or more chronic medications and with a plan to be discharged to the community. The intervention will consist of a ""smart pill-box"" with pre-filled medication trays and several HIT features, including 1) the ability to send alerts to patients or caregivers by phone, email, or text if medication wells in the pillbox are not accessed; and 2) the generation of adherence reports accessible by patients, by caregivers (with patients' permission), and by providers by way of a link embedded within the electronic health record (EHR). Primary outcomes to be evaluated will include medication discrepancies between dispensed medications and the regimen documented in the EHR, and medication adherence based on prescription fill data, i.e., the proportion of days covered. Measures of disease control in patients with hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes mellitus will serve as secondary outcomes. We will also evaluate several measures of implementation of the intervention, such as the use of medication adherence reports by patients, caregivers, and providers. Multivariable regression with general estimating equations will be used to adjust for patient factors and account for clustering at the level of the primary care practice. Lastly, we will conduct semi-structured qualitative interviews of a sample of patients, caregivers, and providers to learn more about the usability of the intervention and any barriers and facilitators of implementation. This study will advance the field of medication safety by quantifying the benefits of this type of intervention in the transitions setting, where it has not been previously evaluated and where there is demonstrable need for improvement.",1,1,,1,,,,,smart pill-box intervention for patients that links to EHR technology,1
20164015,"Reducing health disparities in serious mental illness (SMI), rural and minority populations","Disabled persons under the age of 65 who qualify for Medicare (MD<65) appear to have unique challenges in obtaining health care, poor health outcomes, and high costs of care although research on the population remains limited. Comorbid and serious mental illness appears to strengthen the association between disability and poor health outcomes. This study addresses the effects of disability and comorbid mental illness of the MD<65 by examining self-care capacity, its relationship to health status, and over a 14-year period, to selected illness trajectories and health outcomes, considering community capacity to support health, quality of health care, and intersecting effects of gender, race, and rurality. The health care experiences of three groups of the MD<65 will be compared: the physically disabled (PHYS), physically disabled with co-morbid mental disorders (CMD), and seriously mentally ill disabled (SMI) and then contrasted with Medicare recipients 65 and older. The study design and analyses are guided by an empirically supported multi-factorial health outcomes model developed by the two PIs. Investigators will use the Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey (MCBS) and Medicare claims data (MCD) employing multilevel analyses, and will first examine the influence of community capacity on self-care capacity and health status for 47,680 Medicare recipients, MD<65 with PHYS, CMB, and SMI contrasted with MD>65. Next, detailed 14-year longitudinal profiles of received health care will be constructed for those with cardiovascular disease (CVD) and diabetes mellitus (DM), co-morbidities prevalent in the disabled. Employing a longitudinal, population analytic design, investigators will estimate survival on health/illness trajectories for selected outcomes, including mortality, in each group. At each level of analysis investigators will also examine the influence of gender, race, and rurality to assess the extent to which intersecting effects of each identity further affect morbidity and mortality disparities seen. The aggregation of Medicare claims data with other datasets we will use in the proposed research will enable us to identify community-level and health system factors that contribute to worsening health, increased utilization, and high health care costs, which in turn will enable investigators to make specific recommendations for individual- and system-level health care interventions. The proposed research will provide key information about MD<65 as a whole and how health and mental health comorbidities accrue and influence the development of disparities in health outcomes in each group.",1,1,,1,1,,,,community factors and health system factors relating to health status,1
20171078,Integrating mobile e-health into hypertension and diabetes management in Cambodia,"The population of Cambodia is rapidly aging. Life expectancy at birth has increased from 58 years in 1995 to 71 years in 2012, driving the rate of previously unknown non-communicable diseases (NCDs) skyward. Ischemic heart disease and stroke are now the top two causes of mortality in this low-income country, and rates of cardiovascular risk factors including hypertension and diabetes are dramatically increasing. While the Cambodian government has done little to address the growing burden of NCDs afflicting its people, a non-governmental organization (NGO), MoPoTsyo Patient Information Center, has stepped in. Using a model of community-based patient-led Peer Educator Networks, MoPoTsyo is currently delivering self-management training and medications to over 21,000 hypertensive and diabetic patients in Cambodia. In spite of the considerable success this model has demonstrated, control of these conditions--particularly hypertension among non-diabetics--remains a challenge. The primary aim of this application, in response to PAR-14-028, Mobile Health: Technology and Outcomes in Low and Middle Income Countries (R21), is to enhance the communication network between the MoPoTsyo patient database, peer educators, pharmacies, and patients, using mobile eHealth tools to activate better compliance with treatment guidelines. Specifically, we plan to 1) finalize enhanced features of the mHealth communications application for self-management of hypertension and diabetes, and pilot test it with end-users for acceptability and ease of use; 2) implement a randomized controlled clinical intervention to assess the mHealth communications application in rural and urban-poverty communities for reducing study outcomes related to diabetes and hypertension; and 3) share results with the Cambodian Ministry of Health and development partners in order to inform health policy makers of study findings and to develop strategies for improving control of hypertension and diabetes throughout Cambodia. This e-health communication system using mobile phone technology will include (a) voice messaging in Khmer allowing illiterate users to participate, (b) interactive tailored reminders and messages to patients for improving support for treatment adherence and goal achievement, (c) integration of messages received and responses from users into the health care database to trigger new messages, (d) access to pharmacy data to monitor individual adherence to medication, (e) access of health care information to peer educators to improve monitoring of patients over time, and (f) use of the system to integrate data into the MoPoTsyo database for reports and surveillance of patients. Fifty peer educators representing over 6,000 rural, sub-urban, and urban patients will be randomized to the intervention or control. Process outcomes and health indicators, including control of blood pressure and glucose, medication adherence, and lifestyle factors such as smoking, body mass index, diet, and exercise, will be evaluated. Results will be used to help develop national health policies addressing the great need for NCD control in Cambodia and serve as a model of other countries in SE Asia.",1,,1,,,,,,peer educator networks,1
20172369,Risk stratification and tailoring of prevention programs,"Background: Patients are likely to vary in their response to any given program among the range of prevention programs in VHA. This variation is known as heterogeneity of treatment effects. To improve the effectiveness of new VA investments in prevention programs, it will be necessary to identify which veterans have a better response to each program and which characteristics identify veterans who might require alternative prevention programs. This project is part of a CREATE Program (Collaborative Research to Enhance and Advance Transformation and Excellence) focused on Transforming Prevention into Action. The purpose of this particular CREATE project is to systematically evaluate the heterogeneity of treatment effects (HTE) across the three prevention trials to be conducted as part of the Prevention CREATE. The study will be conducted in close collaboration with the National Center for Health Promotion and Disease Prevention (NCP), which is the VACO Program Office charged with implementing several major programs as part of VHA's Preventive Care Program transformational sub-initiative. These programs include an enterprise-wide Health Risk Assessment (HRA), a four-site demonstration of the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP), and a five-site Telephone Lifestyle Coaching program. HTE assessment is critical to understand which veterans are most likely to benefit, because the effect of these prevention interventions are unlikely to be equally effective for all veterans. VA needs a rigorous method for determining how to prioritize resources to realize the greater return on investment in prevention, and the proposed CREATE study addresses this need. Objectives: The purpose of this project is to leverage a comprehensive set of patient characteristics to be captured in the three other CREATE trials (CREATE projects 1-3) to determine which veterans realize the greatest benefit from PACT (Patient Aligned Care Team) HRA shared decision making, prevention group visits, and web-based physical activity interventions. This study addresses the Prevention CREATE's overall goal by assessing heterogeneity in treatment effects, which will inform VHA how to target programs to veteran needs resulting in the largest impact at the lowest possible cost. The proposed study has two primary aims: (aim #1) determine the participant characteristics associated with response to treatment in the 3 interventions in the Prevention CREATE Program and (aim #2) determine the relationship between VA expenditures and participant characteristics associated with response to treatment. That is, do patterns of heterogeneity in treatment effects translate to similar patterns of heterogeneity in VA expenditures? The secondary aim is to determine the participant characteristics associated with increased per-protocol adherence in the 3 interventions in the Prevention CREATE program. Methods: For behavioral interventions, patient factors expected to be associated with risk of adverse events in the absence of treatment or risk reduction in the presence of treatment are likely to be psychological (e.g., patient activation) and social factors that are only available through survey data, in addition to clinical factors available in medical records and administrative claims data. Therefore, we intend to capture a broad array of patient factors through several data sources to ensure that we accurately reflect the sources of variation in patient response to treatment and a more comprehensive array of self-reported and clinical outcomes. The study population will comprise all VHA outpatients enrolled in each of CREATE Projects 1-3 (n=440 in the HRA shared decision making trial, n=400 in the group prevention coaching trial, n=350 in the web-based physical activity trial). Participant characteristics and setting will be determined by CREATE Projects 1-3. At the completion of CREATE Projects 1-3, factors from the HRA, VA claims, and baseline survey data will be examined as predictors and moderators of treatment response, economic outcomes, and intervention adherence. Findings: None to date. Impact: Results from the proposed study will complement the main analyses of the 3 CREATE trials that will assess overall effectiveness of the HRA shared decision making program, group prevention coaching, and web-based physical activity interventions. In addition, the results will enable VHA to determine which multidimensional subgroups of veterans would be best served by each of the interventions when scaled at a national level. This proposal addresses a long-term goal of developing decision support that VHA can use in prevention programming to effectively improve the health of veterans. This CREATE program is responsive to HSR&D Priority Area C (Healthcare Informatics) because it will develop a systematic approach to assessing HTE, leading eventually to decision support systems that can incorporate multiple veteran characteristics to prevent chronic health conditions.",1,1,,,,,,,patient heterogeneity among different trials,1
20163010,Peer support to enhance diabetes shared medical appointments: examining comparative effectiveness in VA health systems,"Background: Shared medical appointments (SMAs)--group sessions of veterans with the same medical condition led by a multidisciplinary/multi-expertise team of providers--are now being widely implemented at VA facilities nationwide. Efficacy trials have found that SMAs in VA increase access to care and improve participants' self-management, clinical, and veteran-centered outcomes during and immediately after completion of the SMAs. Less is known about the effectiveness of SMAs as implemented on a large scale in different VA health systems, nor about the extent to which gains achieved through SMAs are maintained over time and, if not, what additional scalable approaches can best maintain improvements in self-management and clinical outcomes. Moreover, factors influencing effective implementation of SMAs and follow-up maintenance programs in diverse settings are poorly understood. One potentially scalable approach is telephone-based peer support in which fellow veterans provide support to each other. Because peers share similar characteristics, this approach is intrinsically culturally sensitive. Moreover, because most contacts are over the telephone, it is accessible to vulnerable patients who face obstacles to accessing clinic-based care. Objectives: This project will evaluate the implementation of diabetes SMAs in five VA health systems with some cohorts also being offered a novel program found in a recent VA randomized, controlled trial to significantly improve VA patients' diabetes-specific social support, insulin starts, and glycemic control compared to usual nurse care management. The program uses periodic group sessions in conjunction with calls between paired patients with diabetes to promote more effective care management as well as peer-to-peer (P2P) communication among diabetes patients who both have poor glycemic control and are working on similar care goals. Participants are matched with another patient of similar age and facing similar self-management challenges. ""Peer buddies"" are encouraged to talk by phone at least weekly to provide mutual support and share their progress on meeting their self-management goals. The goal of this service is to enhance the effect of shared medical appointments (SMAs), a service model demonstrated to be effective in improving outcomes among patients with diabetes and other chronic conditions and now being widely implemented in VA. Based on the success of the efficacy trial of this intervention, we now seek to evaluate a wider scale implementation of this program. Methods: Based on the success of separate efficacy trials of diabetes SMAs and of the P2P program, this project will examine the comparative effectiveness of SMAs alone, SMAs + P2P, and usual care without either of these programs and study the implementation process at five diverse VA facilities. Outcomes measured at 6 and 12 months post-enrollment include 1) changes in participants' glycemic and blood pressure control and statin use; 2) service utilization; 3) satisfaction with VA care; 4) diabetes-specific distress; 5) diabetes social support; and 6) diabetes self-management behaviors. Constructs from the Consolidated Framework for Implementation (CFIR) have already been used in a completed pre-implementation formative evaluation at the study sites that was used to refine the implementation plan at each site. CFIR constructs will also be used during the post-implementation evaluation process to identify recommendations for facilitating widespread dissemination efforts and to contribute to the implementation science literature. Data will be gathered throughout implementation on staff effort required in order to calculate costs of the program. Findings: N/A. Impact: This study will provide important information on comparative effectiveness and barriers faced when SMAs and P2P are implemented as part of existing clinical processes.",1,,1,,,,,,shared medical appointments (group-based),1
20163210,Follow-up glucose testing and timely transition to primary care after gestational diabetes,"As many as 60% of women with a pregnancy affected by gestational diabetes (GDM) will develop adult diabetes (type 2 diabetes mellitus, or T2DM) in their next decade. Postpartum glucose testing and continued monitoring in primary care after delivery can identify women at risk, prevent or delay the onset of T2DM, and reduce the severity of complications associated with the disease. However, fewer than half of women with a GDM pregnancy get glucose tests, and very few transfer from obstetric care to primary care in the first six months after delivery. We will analyze data from a large insurance-based data system (OPTUMTM) in two steps. The first step is to identify barriers and facilitators to post-delivery glucose testing with the recommended 84 day period and transition to primary care for continued monitoring. In the second step, we will analyze the contribution of testing and transition to primary care to post-GDM health outcomes (repeat pregnancy with GDM, onset of T2DM, and increase in BMI [as a measure of increased risk for T2DM] within three years post-delivery). This ""big data"" approach will provide the largest sample to date, and the first longitudinal analysis that begins prior to pregnancy and follows the same woman through for three years post-delivery. This data set has already been used to describe health care costs attributable to the economic burden of undiagnosed pre-diabetes, diabetes, and gestational diabetes. Our proposed study will investigate both individual and systems factors that explain why the majority of women with GDM do not take advantage of post-delivery opportunities for prevention of T2DM.",1,1,,1,,,,,individual and systems factors explaining why women with gestational diabetes don't take advantage of opportunities for t2d prevention,1
20163216,Health literacy intervention to improve diabetes outcomes among rural primary care patients,"We will test the effectiveness and fidelity of embedding the American College of Physicians (ACP) diabetes health literacy intervention among patient-centered medical homes throughout rural Arkansas. Proper diabetes self-care requires patients to have considerable knowledge, a range of skills, and to sustain multiple health behaviors. Self-management interventions are needed that have been designed for individuals with lower literacy skills, that can be readily implemented and sustained among rural clinics with limited resources that disproportionately care for patients with limited literacy. Researchers on our team developed an evidence-based, patient-centered, low-literacy ACP intervention promoting diabetes self-care that includes 1) a diabetes guide that uses plain language and descriptive photographs to teach core diabetes concepts and empower patients to initiate behavior change; 2) a brief counseling strategy to assist patients in developing short-term, explicit, and attainable goals for behavior change (""action plans""); 3) a training module for providers (physicians, nurses, medical assistants) that prepares them to assume educator/counselor roles with the Diabetes Guide as a teaching tool; and 4) electronic tracking and monitoring tools for primary care practices. While the intervention has previously been field tested and found to significantly improve patient knowledge, self-efficacy, and engagement in related health behaviors, it has not yet been comprehensively tested in practices, and its optimal implementation is not known. We now have a unique opportunity to learn from our prior evaluation, modify, and disseminate an ACP health literacy intervention among patients with type 2 diabetes cared for at rural clinics in Arkansas that are patient-centered medical homes (PCMH). These practices are embedding care coordination services that can be leveraged to improve chronic disease management. All are supervised by a new University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences (UAMS) Center for Health Literacy. Our revised intervention will blend outsourced and clinic-based approaches and redeploy health coaches for counseling self-management mostly via phone, but also at the point-of-care. This is a feasible way to reach rural, vulnerable patients. We will conduct a patient-randomized, pragmatic clinical trial among 6 rural PCMHs in Arkansas, targeting individuals with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes. Our primary aims are to 1) test the effectiveness of the ACP diabetes health literacy intervention to improve a range of diabetes-related outcomes among rural patients; and 2) compared to usual care, evaluate whether the intervention reduces disparities by patient literacy level. Our secondary aims are to 3) investigate whether a threshold or gradient effect exists between the amount of follow-up counseling (number of action plans) and intervention effectiveness; 4) determine the fidelity of all intervention components, and explore any identified patient, provider (physician, nurse, health coach), and/or health system barriers to implementation; and 5) assess the costs associated with implementing the intervention from a health system perspective.",1,1,,1,,,,,organizational training for providers and counseling session for behavior change,1
20163247,The Alabama Care Plan: assessing the impact of regional care organizations on diabetes outcomes in a sample of Alabama Medicaid recipients,"Despite advances in the scientific knowledge related to diabetes prevention and management, diabetes prevalence, complications, and costs continues to rise. A majority of the dollars that go towards diabetes care are spent on emergency department visits, hospitalizations, and the management of diabetes complications. Changing the trajectory of the diabetes epidemic in the United States may require a fundamentally new approach to chronic disease management and reimbursement that emphasizes disease prevention and management. Accountable care organizations (ACOs) could be such an approach. Under this model, an organization is charged with the care of a population, receives a capitated payment and may be eligible for either a share of any savings achieved and/or at risk for a portion of any spending over the set target. As such, ACOs have been proposed as a means to simultaneously improve population health and reduce health care costs. The Alabama Medicaid program is undergoing a major transformation from a traditional fee-for-service model to the establishment of ACOs (referred to in Alabama as RCOs or regional care organizations). The Alabama Care Plan, one of 6 probationary RCOs, will assume care for over 70,000 Medicaid recipients in Region B, 11% of whom have diabetes. In April 2015, VIVA Health, a local managed care organization and the lead entity in the Alabama Care Plan, began creating care coordination teams that will work with individuals' current health care providers to comprise a larger ""health home."" This phased transition provides a unique opportunity for us to assess the impact of policy change related to reimbursement and the delivery of health care as it relates to diabetes. With this proposal, investigators will conduct a rigorous evaluation of the impact of this transition on outcomes in three dimensions: health of a population, experience of care, and per capita cost. The specific aims are (1) to examine changes in diabetes-related population health measures, including glycemic control (HbA1c) and indicators of diabetes care (quarterly HbA1c, annual eye exam); (2) to examine patient experience of care using a telephone-administered survey and qualitative interviews with a subset of individuals with type 2 diabetes enrolled in the Health Home; and (3) to examine changes in health care utilization and overall cost-effectiveness of the newly implemented RCO and Health Home compared to diabetes care before RCO implementation. Using Medicaid data beginning in 2010 through 2019, investigators will conduct interrupted time series analyses of data from enrollees within Region B and difference-in-differences analyses to compare changes over time in Region B with changes over time in 3 southern, non-ACO states. The multidisciplinary team of investigators has expertise in diabetes research, use of CMS data, survey administration, and qualitative methods. Alabama has the highest rate of diabetes in the United States. As such, this study could have important local and national policy implications for new approaches to diabetes management.",1,,,,,1,,,alabama transition to ACOs,1
20171197,"Glycemic control: overtreatment, hypoglycemia, mortality and de-intensification","Serious hypoglycemic reactions are one of the most common adverse drug events and are now recognized as a major public health issue. From the mid-2000s to mid-2012, non-VA guidelines emphasized tight control of glycemia for most patients. Our recent publication reported that as many as 70% of all veterans on hypoglycemic agents are at high risk, and about half of those may have been overtreated in 2009 based on a proposed overtreatment measure (hemoglobin A1c < 7%). This measure has been accepted as a concept measure for future development by CMS, following endorsement by the HHS Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology. Objectives: Among various subgroups of high-risk patients receiving insulin and/or secretagogues treatment during the period 2004-2016, aim 1 is to assess the changes in rates and trends of potential overtreatment; aim 2 is to evaluate annual rates, trends, and correlates of serious hypoglycemic events (resulting in emergency department visits or hospitalizations); aim 3 is to study rates and trends, and risk factors of mortality among high-risk patients; and aim 4 is to explore de-intensification of glycemic control among potentially overtreated patients. Methods: We utilized both serial cross-sectional (aims 1, 2, 3) and longitudinal (aims 2, 3, 4) analyses of veteran patients based on linked VHA and CMS data files from years 2002 to 2016. We identified patients receiving insulin and/or secretagogues, dually enrolled in Medicare fee-for-service and removed those with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), in a hospice program or long-term care facilities. Analyses began with inspection of frequency distributions, bivariate analyses of rates among subgroups defined by our independent variables, and use of graphical methods for exploratory data analysis. Advanced statistical modeling will include marginal-generalized estimating equations models with a logit link, Cox proportional hazards models, and the recursive partition classification tree method. Findings: Study populations younger than 65 years in years 2004-2012 ranged from 22,420-30,822: 60-65% were white, 15-19% black, 7-8% Hispanic, 3-5% women. Insulin use increased over the years, from 40% in 2004 to 57% in 2012. There were 37-43%, 9-12%, and 43-49% with mental health conditions (M), substance use (SU), and cardiovascular conditions (C), respectively. Higher percentages of blacks (16%) and Hispanics (16%) than whites (9%) had SU. Patients with SU had higher serious hypoglycemia rates than others regardless of race; in 2012, blacks (55 events per 1,000 patients) and Hispanics (48) had more than 1.5 fold higher risks than whites (31). Those with only M or only C had similar rates to those with none of the three conditions. Rates decreased markedly in most patient groups with SU starting around year 2007. In 3,465 veterans >= 65 years receiving only basal insulin in 2009-2011, 457 (13%) died or incurred serious hypoglycemic events. Of the 200 (5.8%) that incurred hypoglycemic events, 16%, 24.5%, and 23% had the event within 1, 2-3, and 4-6 months, respectively; of the 271 (7.8%) deaths, 10.7%, 12.5%, and 25.8% occurred in the same time intervals. Of the 2,789 (80%) patients having some A1c values within a year post-prandial, 10% had an A1c<6.5%. Compared to whites (n=2,708; 78%), blacks (336; 10%) had a higher hypoglycemia rate (8.0% vs. 5.6%, p=0.08) and a comparable death rate (8.6% vs. 8.4%, p=0.88). Both races had similar rates of having an A1c<6.5% (11.6% vs. 13.1%, p=0.48). Impact: In January 2015 VA launched a Hypoglycemic Safety Initiative in the context of the Choosing Wisely Campaign, emphasizing the importance of avoiding overtreatment in high-risk populations defined by the overtreatment measure. This study will pioneer among federal agencies in the development of an administrative data base approach to tracking prevention and surveillance of serious hypoglycemic events that could be used to evaluate success of federal initiatives.",1,1,,,,,,,insulin and end stage renal disease,1
20173378,Ongoing diabetes self-management support in church-based settings,"Evidence demonstrates the benefits of diabetes self-management education (DSME) on diabetes knowledge and self-care behavior, clinical outcomes, quality of life, use of primary and preventive services, and lower costs. While the initial benefits of DSME are well documented, the effects decline approximately six months following DSME. Additionally, the majority of studies in this area are singularly focused and comparisons between multiple approaches are limited. The 2012 National Standards for DSME and Support emphasize the importance of providing both initial DSME and ongoing diabetes self-management support (DSMS) to assist people with diabetes in maintaining effective self-management throughout a lifetime. While a great deal is understood about how to provide effective DSME, less is known about how to provide effective DSMS. Additionally, DSME is a covered benefit in the health care system, while DSMS is not. This ultimately limits access and availability of DSMS programs, therefore posing a critical need to develop, evaluate, and understand effective DSMS models that are ongoing, patient-driven, responsive to change, and embedded in existing community infrastructures. African American churches are a potentially effective venue for delivering such interventions. The goal of this proposal is to examine the effectiveness of three DSMS approaches compared to enhanced usual care within the context of churches. A cluster randomized, practical behavioral trial with three parallel intervention groups will be implemented. Twenty-one churches in metro-Detroit will be randomized to either 1) Parish Nurse+Peer Leader DSMS, 2) Parish Nurse DSMS, or 3) Peer Leader DSMS. All participants will begin with enhanced usual care and transition into the respective DSMS groups based on church membership. Each church will enroll 20-23 individuals with type 2 diabetes, who will be offered six weeks of DSME, followed by 12 months of support group sessions led by either the parish nurse, peer leader, or a combination of both. Following DSMS, all participants and churches will transition into a one-year period of ongoing support to evaluate if participants, parish nurses, and peer leaders sustain self-management efforts by capitalizing on the infrastructure of the church. We hypothesize that 1) participants in both Parish Nurse DSMS and Peer Leader DSMS will have improved outcomes over enhanced usual care and that 2) participants in Parish Nurse+Peer Leader DSMS will sustain improvements in outcomes achieved following DSME at significantly higher levels than participants in Parish Nurse DSMS and Peer Leader DSMS. We anticipate that providing formal infrastructure and supervision for peer leaders is critical in the uptake of DSMS. All interventions will be superior to enhanced usual care. A similar pattern of findings is anticipated for blood pressure, weight, and quality of life. The cost-effectiveness and long-term impact of each approach will be determined. This information will have significant public health impact and will be pivotal in determining effective sustainable strategies and approaches to address DSMS in underserved communities.",1,,1,,,,,,peer leader diabetes self management support,1
20182603,Adapting the Diabetes Prevention Program for a developing world context,"As a result of globalization and economic advancement, countries like South Africa (SA) are experiencing a ""risk transition"" in which disease prevalence is shifting from being primarily infectious in nature to being primarily non-communicable in nature. This is presenting significant challenges for the health care systems of countries with scarce resources. In the U.S., evidence from large, rigorous RCTs clearly indicate that lifestyle interventions such as the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) can enable overweight individuals to change their diet and physical activity levels and significantly reduce their risk for diabetes mellitus (DM) and cardiovascular (CVD) diseases, but the program has not been adapted for delivery in a developing word setting. The purpose of this proposal is to adapt the DPP and evaluate its feasibility and effectiveness in an urban settlement community in SA. Three initial adaptations to the DPP are proposed for this setting: (1) deliver treatment in a group format using community health workers (CHWs); (2) enhance the DPP through interactive text messaging; and (3) enhance CHWs' communications skills through simplified motivational interviewing (MI) training. The RE-AIM model will be used to guide our intervention adaptations in order to maximize public health impact. Feasibility and effectiveness of the DPP-SA will be assessed in a ""real world"" trial using a large team of CHWs currently deployed in this community to help overweight/obese individuals with DM and/or CVD. We plan a 2-year cluster randomized trial in which we will randomize 54 existing ""health clubs"" (N=540) to receive the DPP South Africa (DPP-SA) or usual care (wait-list). The primary outcome analysis will compare percentage of baseline weight loss at Y1 between DPP-SA and usual care; however, after Y1 usual care participants will also receive the DPP-SA and both groups will be followed for another year. This will allow us to assess whether the wait-list group's results after one year of treatment are similar to the original group's outcomes and examine whether the original group maintains its outcomes over two years. Secondary outcomes will include DM and cardiovascular risk indicators (blood pressure, hemoglobin A1C, lipids), changes in medication use, diet (fat and fruit and vegetable intake), physical activity, and health-related quality of life. Feasibility and process outcomes will be assessed among NGO staff, CHWs, and participants. We will also prepare the DPP-SA for dissemination through development of training curricula, establishing university training courses, engaging other stakeholders who are candidates for dissemination, and assessing the cost-effectiveness of the intervention with respect to cost per kg of weight loss and key secondary outcomes.",1,1,1,,,,,,DPP plus delivery via community health workers,1
20162175,Changing the default for tobacco treatment,"One billion people will die from tobacco-related illnesses this century. Most health care providers, however, fail to treat tobacco dependence. This may in part be due to the treatment ""default."" Current treatment guidelines recommend that providers a) ask patients if they are willing to quit, and b) provide cessation-focused medications and counseling only to smokers who state they are willing to quit. For other health conditions--diabetes, hypertension, asthma, and even substance abuse--the treatment default is to a) identify the health condition and b) initiate evidence-based treatment. For example, when a patient is newly diagnosed with hypertension, they aren't asked if they are ""ready"" to start treatment. The physician simply begins with a prescription or discussion of treatment options. As with any health care treatment option, patients are free to decline--they can ""opt out"" if they wish to refuse care. If patients do nothing, they will receive care. For tobacco users, however, the default is that they have to ""opt in"" to receive cessation assistance: providers ask smokers if they are willing to quit, and only offer medications and cessation support to those who say ""yes."" This drastically limits the reach of cessation services because, at any given encounter, only 1 in 3 smokers say they are ready to quit. As a result, few receive medications or cessation counseling. Recent studies suggest that, when provided with cessation medications and counseling, ""unmotivated"" smokers are as likely to quit as ""motivated"" smokers. Hence, there is a critical need to examine the impact of changing the treatment default on utilization and quitting. The objective of this application is to determine the impact of providing all smokers with tobacco treatment unless they refuse it (OPT OUT) versus current practice--screening for readiness and only offering treatment to smokers who say they are ready to quit (OPT IN). The study employs an individually randomized design, and is conducted in a tertiary care hospital. We will conduct the trial among 1,000 randomly selected hospitalized smokers to determine the population impact of changing the treatment default, identify mediators of outcome, and determine the cost-effectiveness of this new, highly proactive approach. This is a population-based study that targets an endpoint of vital interest, applies minimal eligibility criteria to broaden generalizability, and utilizes hospital staff for interventions to ensure long-term sustainability. The study employs an innovative Bayesian adaptive design to evaluate a major shift in our approach to care. If effective, this change would expand the reach of tobacco treatment from 30% to 100% of smokers.",1,1,,,,,,,opt in vs. opt out defaults,1
20163248,Harmonization of existing registries of diabetes in youth,"Diabetes affects nearly 26 million people in the U.S. and over 62 million in India, placing these nations second and third in the world in terms of population burden of diabetes. Diabetes is reported as increasing in younger age groups both in India and the US, with long-term implications for burden of complications, health care costs, and risk of diabetes in future generations. In 2000, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) established the Registry of People with Diabetes with Young Age at Onset (YDR), including youth and young adults less than 25 years of age from eight sites across India. In the U.S., the SEARCH for Diabetes in Youth study is a multicenter epidemiologic study conducting population-based case ascertainment of youth with diabetes before age 20 years since 2001, currently in five locations across the U.S. However, the ability to compare the epidemiologic characteristics of diabetes in youth between India and the U.S. is at present lacking. Knowledge of whether prevalence, incidence, mortality, and clinical presentation, treatment, quality of care, and quality of life differ can lead to new insights into the potential causes and improved treatment. A sensitive surveillance system in both countries can also inform policy about whether changes in underlying risk factors such as obesity, environmental exposures, and other factors are leading to an increase in risk, or whether improved nutrition and environmental hygiene have reduced risk over time. These challenges have been identified by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) and the ICMR, who sponsored an Indo-U.S. workshop titled ""Innovative Approaches and Technologies for Diabetes Prevention and Management,"" held on February 4-6, 2013, in New Delhi. In response to the recent NIDDK funding opportunity announcement (FOA), we propose to conduct preliminary harmonization work of U.S. and Indian registries of childhood diabetes to address several specific aims: (aim 1) to harmonize the Indian YDR and the SEARCH registry in the U.S; (aim 2) to compare phenotypic, clinical, and demographic characteristics by type of diabetes between YDR and SEARCH; and (aim 3) to compare the burden of diabetes in youth by age, sex, race/ethnicity, and type of diabetes between India and the US. Harmonization of the SEARCH and YDR registries is a critical step towards building capacity to understand global trends. This application is significant in proposing to harmonize registries covering both T1D and T2D at a critical moment in history when trends in diabetes are dynamic yet poorly understood from a global perspective.",1,,,,,,1,,harmonizing Indian and US diabetes registries in youth,1
20143401,Improving medication adherence in the Alabama Black Belt,"Improving medication adherence is one of the greatest challenges in modern medicine. Despite decades of research on the topic, as many as half of patients with chronic diseases are not taking medications as recommended, and costs of nonadherence have been estimated at $290 billion annually. One reason for this persistent finding could be that interventions rarely acknowledge medications within the larger context of the lived experience of illness. Drawing on hundreds of patient interviews, Corbin and Strauss showed that chronic illness is a fundamentally destabilizing influence that forces us to confront the potential limitations of our new, chronically ill self. Accepting our illness may be a crucial step in embracing medication adherence and other self-management behaviors as ways to restore balance following this disruption. The Corbin and Strauss framework is not often used to develop and test interventions to improve medication adherence, and this is the central objective of this proposal. Medication adherence is especially critical in regions like rural Alabama, where residents have among the worst health outcomes in the US. Rates of cardiovascular mortality, diabetes, and obesity are very high, but resources are scarce and the area's predominately black residents have deep-seated mistrust of the health care system (the region includes Tuskegee, site of the infamous syphilis study). This project was designed in collaboration with our community member partners and builds on a five-year partnership of community-engaged research on diabetes peer coaching interventions and our experience with peer storytelling. We will test the hypothesis that an intervention designed within the Corbin and Strauss framework can improve adherence and health outcomes compared to usual care. Our aims are as follows. Aim 1 is, with our community partners, using qualitative research methods, to build on already developed culturally tailored education material to develop the medication adherence intervention. The intervention will consist of educational DVDs with integrated storytelling about how community members accepted their disease and overcame barriers to medication adherence, plus one-on-one telephonic peer coaching. Activities include conducting focus groups with patients; creating the DVDs and the coaching intervention protocol; training peer coaches; and pilot testing. Aim 2 is to conduct a randomized controlled trial with 500 individuals with type 2 diabetes and medication nonadherence. The trial will compare the effect of usual care and the intervention on medication adherence and physiologic risk factors including A1c, blood pressure, and low density lipoprotein cholesterol (primary outcomes), and quality of life and self-efficacy (secondary outcomes). This innovative approach would be a major shift in how we help patients in under resourced areas living with chronic diseases commit to taking medications, improving health, and eventually reducing health disparities.",1,,1,,,,,,"development of interactive, peer coaching intervention for med adherence",1
20162165,Concept mapping as a scalable method for identifying patient-important outcomes,"Patients are often minimally engaged about their priorities or needs when seeking medical care, leading to treatment plans that may not be optimally designed to meet those needs. For example, patients may care more about their ability to participate in family events, while clinicians or investigators may be more interested in preventing hard medical outcomes and avoiding hospital readmissions. PCORI addresses this disconnect by encouraging the use of patient-centered outcomes for use in research; however, there is currently limited evidence for how best to identify what these patient-centered outcomes should be. One-on-one interviews and focus groups are most often used to engage patients. While these methods provide valuable information, they are often time consuming and may leave the final process of analyzing data and identifying outcomes in the hands of researchers instead of patients. Thus, patient-centered researchers would benefit from the development of additional methods for identifying individual patient-important outcomes. We suggest that concept mapping--a method for participant engagement commonly used in nonhealthcare research settings--may be one such efficient and effective method. Concept mapping is a group process that takes place over multiple sessions in which participants: 1) brainstorm ideas, 2) organize ideas, and 3) analyze ideas to generate a final list of ""outcome clusters."" In this proposal, we plan to test concept mapping and one-on-one interviews as two methods to elicit patient-important outcomes for management of diabetes mellitus. We will assess the comprehensiveness of the outcomes produced by each of the two methods and will then look at the efficiency of performing both methods (primarily an assessment of the time required from both patients and investigators). We will test our aims by engaging a population of patients with moderately to poorly controlled diabetes, as this is a population that has been identified by our institution as well as multiple national healthcare groups as having an especially high burden of disease. We are performing all of our work in close collaboration with our Patient and Key Stakeholder Advisory Board (PAKSAB), whose members are equal partners with the research team and have been involved with the proposal from inception. PAKSAB members will also conduct the aims and assist with all analysis and data interpretation. This work is patient-centered in the process as well as in the outcomes, engaging patient partners in the advisory board and research team, and patient participants in all data collection, and generating a list of patient-important outcomes for patients with diabetes in managing their chronic disease(s).",1,1,,,,,,,outcomes that are important for patients with diabetes ,1
20171149,Encouraging patient-centered communication in clinical video telehealth visits,"Background: Clinical video telehealth (CVT) offers the opportunity for more efficient access to high-quality primary and specialist care for veterans. Enthusiasm for CVT is especially high in the VA given geographical separation between many veterans and their providers at VA medical centers. However, because CVT encounters are by nature less personal than in-person visits, communication during CVT visits may be more challenging for both patients and providers, resulting in less patient-centered communication. Less personal visits may have less exchange of information, lower satisfaction, less trust, and poorer outcomes. Indeed, research comparing CVT with in-person consultations found that patients in CVT visits were more passive and that CVT interactions were dominated by providers when compared with in-person visits. This project will leverage prior work from two HSR&D-funded pilot projects to improve provider-patient communication for veterans with type 2 diabetes mellitus. In a short-term project, SHP-08-182, the investigators conducted focus groups to elicit and understand patients' barriers to communicating with their providers. This qualitative work was used in a subsequent pilot project, PPO-08-402, to develop an educational video to encourage veterans to use active participatory communication in their visits to providers. This work was successfully completed and the product is a 10-minute video that, in testing, was found to be acceptable and feasible to show to VA patients immediately preceding their medical encounters. Objectives: The investigator's goal in this project is to develop and test a video intervention and to also develop pamphlets for patients and providers to encourage active and positive communication in CVT medical interactions. The investigator's goal was developed with and is supported by the project's operational partner, the Office of Telehealth Services, and is integral to the goal to ensure patient-centered care in new models of care. Patient-centered communication in medical interactions is critical and plays an important, but often overlooked, role in the delivery of health services. There are two aims. First, the investigators will develop educational interventions to encourage patients and providers to use active communication behaviors during CVT visits. Second, the investigators will conduct a randomized trial of the video and pamphlet (intervention) vs. pamphlet alone (comparison) in a two-arm randomized effectiveness trial. The investigators will evaluate for improvement in visit outcomes, including patient and provider measures of patient-centered care and communication, reduction in several common barriers to clinical improvement, and improved medication adherence measures and hemoglobin A1c. In addition, the investigators will assess the mediators and moderators of the relationship of the intervention condition to outcomes. Methods: The project will have two phases. In the initial phase of the proposed project the investigators will develop the video intervention. Video development will include qualitative interviews with stakeholders and patients regarding CVT barriers and perceived benefits. The investigators will use several existing resources and an expert panel of co-investigators and consultants to bring these elements together and produce the intervention. In phase 2 the investigators will conduct a randomized trial of the intervention, evaluating for improvement in a number of outcomes. Findings: We presented initial findings from phase 1 at the annual meeting of the Society of General Internal Medicine in April 2018. The citation and text for the two abstracts presented, one oral and one poster, is provided below. 1. Gordon H, Gopal RK, Bokhour BG, Solanki P, Westmoreland V, Skorohod N. CVT changes how you work. Provider perspectives on medical care in clinical video telehealth visits. Poster presentation at the 2018 SGIM Annual Meeting, April 13, 2018. Abstract appears in Journal of General Internal Medicine. 33(2) Supplement, S83-84. 2018. Background: Health care provider-patient communication during clinical video telehealth (CVT) visits may be less patient-centered than communication in face-to-face encounters. Methods: Providers and staff (N=10) experienced in CVT at one large Veterans Affairs medical center participated in semi-structured in-depth 45- to 60-minute telephone interviews. Interviews included questions about participants' perspectives on facilitators and barriers to communicating using CVT technology in comparison to face-to-face visits. Interviews were audio-recorded, and transcribed verbatim. Interviews were coded using a grounded approach; four coders discussed each transcript to establish a coding dictionary. Subsequent transcripts were coded by two coders, and discrepancies were resolved through discussion. Using the constant comparison method fundamental to grounded theory analysis, thematic categories were identified in each transcript. Coherence, credibility, and strength of those interpretations were achieved with multidisciplinary triangulation among the full research team. Results: We identified four themes describing perspectives on how CVT changes the style of providers' work: (1) technological and logistical barriers, (2) patient characteristics that impact CVT visits, (3) providers perceptions and satisfaction, and (4) communication differences between face-to-face and CVT visit. Examples from these themes include providers' frustration with equipment issues and with communicating with different staff, and different local resources for clinical testing, imaging, and emergency service at different patient locations. Providers noted that some patient characteristics, such as hearing difficulty and comfort with technology, make CVT visits more challenging. Providers also noted a need to more carefully self-monitor their behavior (e.g., maintain eye contact) and to explain the logistics of the telehealth visit so patients are well oriented. Differences between CVT and face-to-face visits included that providers expressed limited ability to provide written instructions or give demonstrations during the visit, described CVT as ""unfamiliar territory"" because of an unfamiliarity with patients known only through CVT, and providers indicated challenges completing the physical exam, including inconsistent availability of staff to assist with CVT equipment, and losing the senses of touch and smell when remote staff ""become the [provider's] hands."" Conclusions: Providers in our study revealed that CVT requires them to change several aspects of their interactions and communication with patients as compared to traditional face-to-face visits. Our findings may be used to develop interventional materials to encourage active and positive communication targeted to patients and providers scheduled for CVT encounters. Educational tools that encourage more patient-centered communication during CVT encounters may allow more rapid acceptance of CVT, thereby improving access to health care in underserved areas. 2.

Patients' perspectives on communicating in clinical video telehealth visits. Oral presentation at the 2018 SGIM Annual Meeting, April 14, 2018. Abstract appears in: Journal of General Internal Medicine. 33(2) Supplement, S222. 2018. Background: Clinical video telehealth (CVT) offers the opportunity to improve access to health care providers in medically underserved areas. However, because CVT encounters are mediated through technology, they may result in unintended consequences related to the patient-provider interaction. Methods: Twenty-seven patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and at least one previous telehealth visit experience were interviewed about their perspectives on facilitators and barriers to communication with their provider during their CVT visit. The semi-structured telephone interviews were 45-60 minutes, and were audio-recorded and transcribed. A coding dictionary was established, with codes derived from the data. All transcripts were coded by two researchers and the discrepancies were resolved through discussion by four research team members. Using the constant comparison method fundamental to grounded theory analysis, codes and thematic categories were identified in each transcript. Coherence, credibility, and strength of those interpretations were achieved with triangulation among the multidisciplinary research team. Results: We identified seven themes related to patients' perspectives on CVT: 1) technological and logistical barriers to CVT, 2) benefits of CVT, 3) medical visit issues, 4) patient's challenges in communication, 6) provider behaviors, and 7) patients' trust in provider and staff. Patients expressed their satisfaction with CVT because of shorter wait times prior to the visit and shorter travel distances. Patients also described their challenges in effectively communicating with the provider, concerns pertaining to adequacy of physical examination, and lack of consistency of the providers. Challenges in communication included that patients reported feeling less involved during the visit, difficulty finding opportunities to speak, and feeling rushed by the provider. Patients were concerned about the potential for errors in their care related to the use of a combination of CVT staff and technology to complete the physical examination. Patients reported that establishing a relationship and developing trust with their CVT provider was more difficult compared with face-to-face visits and that staff turnover contributed to this challenge. Conclusions: Our findings revealed that patients perceived benefits and difficulties with CVT. Patients believed that CVT was efficient and improved access, but CVT visits posed challenges for patients' communication with their provider when compared with face-to-face visits. Our results can be used to develop communication skills training programs to encourage active and positive communication by patients and providers engaging in CVT visits. Educational tools that encourage more patient-centered communication in CVT visits may allow for more widespread acceptance and utilization of CVT, thereby increasing access to care in rural areas. Additional research should examine how to reduce patient concerns about the physical exam in CVT visits. Impact: We presented two abstracts at the April 2018 annual meeting of SGIM. We presented one of these abstracts at VA research day in May 2018. We discussed our educational tools at a staff meeting of the Office of Connected Care and we are working with OCC on dissemination of the educational tools. Our educational tools are deliverables that could be used prior to CVT visits to improve communication and could serve as a paradigm for developing communication aids for other medical conditions and other clinical settings. Our continued work will evaluate whether our educational intervention(s) will help improve communication and will be associated with better visit and intermediate outcomes. Educational tools that encourage more patient-centered communication during CVT encounters may allow more rapid acceptance of CVT, thereby improving access to health care and enhancing the operational mission of the project's partner.",1,1,1,,,,,,telemedicine intervention to make visits more patient-centered,1
20161043,The next frontier in diabetes communication: promoting health literacy in the era of secure messaging,"Limited health literacy (HL) places individuals at greater risk of type 2 diabetes (DM2) and its complications, is a marker of vulnerability, and presents a critical clinical and public health problem. To be health literate in the 21st century, patients will need a certain level of linguistic facility, in combination with technical skills, to access services via online patient portals. Our research has shown that DM2 patients with limited HL are actively using patient portals. However, as health care becomes increasingly dependent on electronic communications (e.g., secure messages via internet-based patient portals), patients with limited HL may have difficulty communicating electronically with their clinician or understanding their clinician's secure message responses or instructions. For clinicians to electronically provide meaningful and actionable information and support, their secure messages must be written in an easily comprehended style. Few studies have examined how patients with limited HL interact with their health care providers via patient portals. This transdisciplinary proposal, involving a team of health services researchers, health communication scientists, and computational linguists, will focus on a population of ethnically diverse DM2 patients and their primary care providers from 1) a large, integrated group model HMO with a well-developed patient portal, and 2) a county-run, integrated public (safety net) delivery system with a newly launched electronic health record and patient portal. Our study is designed around a conceptual framework promoted most recently by the Institute of Medicine: overcoming the challenges LHL patients face in managing DM2 requires that health care systems, and their clinicians, make accommodations to meet patients' communication needs. The degree of linguistic ""mismatch"" observed in secure message exchanges between DM2 patients and their providers, measured using computational linguistics, will serve as one indicator of the extent to which providers are, or are not, making such accommodations. Our specific aims are to (aim 1) develop and validate a novel, automated linguistic complexity profile (LCP) to assess secure message content generated by DM2 patients and their providers via patient portals. We will employ natural language processing (NLP) to develop and validate the LCP, based on secure messages and data from >200,000 DM2 patients. The LCP will demonstrate construct validity with patient HL and patient reports of provider communication, and will be associated with DM2 outcomes; (aim 2) examine whether concordance between provider and patient LCP is associated with adherence among DM2 patients newly prescribed insulin or antidepressants; (aim 3) characterize the collaborative nature of exchanges between providers and low LCP patients, using mixed methods, to enhance our understanding of communication in the critical period surrounding initiation of insulin or antidepressants; and (aim 4) create an automated, LCP-based prototype to provide real-time feedback to providers while writing secure messages to reduce linguistic complexity and better accommodate DM2 patients' linguistic skills and HL.",1,,,1,,,,,improving linguistic complexity in patient portal data,1
20161397,"Use of gamified social media with home telemonitoring for patient self-management in poorly controlled Medicaid diabetics: a pilot study of health outcomes, social influences, and habit formation","Diabetes is a prevalent disease that causes significant morbidity, mortality, and costs. While there is no known cure, complications from diabetes can be minimized by lifestyle and medical interventions. To be maximally impactful, both lifestyle and medical interventions require lifelong, daily actions by patients for self-management of their disease condition, including taking prescribed medications on time and testing their blood sugar levels. The proposed pilot study investigates whether gamified social media with a competitive game element that is used in conjunction with home telemonitoring can be effective in enhancing patients' self-management of diabetes, thereby reducing their HgbA1C levels and increasing their diabetes self-efficacy. Sixty adult Medicaid patients with poorly controlled diabetes (HgbA1C >7.0%) will be recruited for the study from a partnering urban teaching hospital that operates primary care clinics. Informed consent will be obtained by researchers, and data on blood glucose/HgbA1C levels, demographic, clinical, social networks, and other behavioral and psychosocial variables will be collected at various times during the study through surveys and blood testing. An innovative community health care provider partner will install home telemonitoring equipment (glucometer with Bluetooth connection to a wireless tablet), and centrally monitor daily fasting blood glucose levels. Patients will be randomized equally to control and intervention groups. All patients will be asked to perform daily fasting blood glucose testing throughout the eight-month study period, and compliance with this task along with actual daily blood glucose levels will be monitored. All patients will also receive a social media app on their tablets that will provide self-management reminders to perform glucometry during the first two-month baseline period. Gamification will then be added to patients' tablets in the intervention group only for the second three-month intervention period. On a daily basis, intervention patients will receive anonymous visualizations of their compliance and actual blood glucose levels compared to others in the intervention group for the previous day. Winners will be announced for best performance in the intervention group. Finally, both groups of patients will have their social media app (and gamification) removed from the tablets for the third and final three-month withdrawal period, but be asked to continue performing daily blood glucose testing. Data will be analyzed to investigate whether the gamified social media app used in conjunction with home telemonitoring improves blood glucose levels, HgbA1C levels, and diabetes self-efficacy. We will also investigate whether social influence from patients social networks around their diabetes acts as an antecedent of usage of the proposed technology, and/or as a moderator of the impact of the technology intervention on outcomes. Finally, outcomes from the third three-month withdrawal period will be evaluated to determine whether the intervention resulted in positive habit formation. Demonstration of beneficial health behavior habit formation from the gamified social media app could prove to be a cost-effective strategy to combat this prevalent disease.",1,1,,,,,,,gamified social media,1
20162042,State Innovation Model Initiative impacts on diabetes prevention and management,"To stimulate health system transformation, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) launched the State Innovation Model (SIM) Initiative, which since 2013, has invested more than 1 billion dollars in state efforts to plan, pilot test, and implement payment and delivery system reforms. The SIM Initiative is an ongoing, naturally occurring federal-state ""policy intervention"" that provides financial and technical support to states for development and testing state-led multi-payer health care payment and service delivery models. The goals of this federal-state program are to improve health system performance, improve the quality of patient care, and decrease health care costs for all residents of the state. As states are investing in transformational restructuring of incentives and delivery systems, the SIM Initiative is anticipated to improve health status overall, including diabetes risk and health status in large segments of the community. In order to achieve SIM Initiative goals, most SIM states are focusing on chronic illness, in general, and diabetes, in particular. We propose a natural experiment rigorously designed to optimize the ability to draw causal inferences. Using diverse data from multiple sources we will assess this population-targeted policy to assess outcomes at multiple levels, including state, county, and physician organization and delivery system levels. From 2015 to 2019, we will monitor and track payment and delivery system reforms relevant to preventing, and managing complications of, diabetes. This will be done for 18 purposively sampled states: 6 ""Round 1"" states, 6 ""Round 2"" states, and 6 ""waiting control"" states. Using these policy data, we will develop a taxonomy of state SIM implementation to empirically examine how SIM implementation affects practice implementation of the patient-centered medical home (PCMH) model and participation in accountable care organizations (ACOs). We will use propensity score matching of patients in a stepped-wedge research design to examine the impact of the staged implementation of SIM plans across the states. We will estimate the impact of the SIM Initiative on diabetes-related health behaviors (2011-2018) and hospitalizations due to diabetes (2011-2017) for ""Round 1"" vs. ""Round 2"" vs. ""waiting control states."" The influence of delivery system and payment reform activities implemented as part of each states' SIM plan will be explored. Finally, we estimate the economic impact of the SIM Initiative's improvements in diabetes care prevention and management and explore heterogeneity in economic impacts across SIM states. The proposed collaborative project will yield actionable data and analyses to state and local health officials, and public health and health care delivery stakeholders on the impact of the SIM Initiative on improvements on diabetes prevention and management.",1,,,1,,,,,"state innovation models, CMS",1
20162045,A partnered evaluation of United Healthcare (UHC) Medicaid plan innovations for diabetes patients,"Our UCLA team, in partnership with United Healthcare (UHC), proposes to form a cooperative agreement with the CDC and NIDDK to evaluate the impact of two highly innovative programs in Medicaid known as the Accountable Care Communities (ACC) Program and the Health Home (HH) Program. Both programs are delivery system transformations with on-the-ground partnerships to support improvements in care and population management strategies for Medicaid beneficiaries, many of whom have diabetes and other complex care needs. The implementation of the ACC and HH programs by one of the nation's largest for-profit insurance companies who has over 1 million new Medicaid enrollees since 2012, represents a unique and very timely evaluation of real-world interventions. The overall goal of the research is to employ rigorous empirical evaluation of the impact of these innovative programs on the delivery, outcomes, and cost of care for adult Medicaid enrollees with diabetes. Our specific aims are as follows: 1) to evaluate whether the Medicaid ACC Program, which provides on-the-ground partnerships that embed UHC transformation consultants and nurses into practices to support improvements in care, provides access to complete healthcare and community-wide data analytics to support population management, and includes practice-level financial incentives, such as shared savings programs, will lead to improvements in adherence to medications and diabetes processes of care, in A1c and LDL-c control, fewer emergency room visits and hospitalizations, and lower overall costs of care; 2) to evaluate whether the Medicaid HH Program, which targets patients with serious chronic physical and mental health conditions who also have high social needs and high costs of care, and provides them intensive, individualized care management from an integrated team inclusive of community health workers, will lead to improvement in adherence to medications and diabetes processes of care, in A1c and LDL-c control, fewer emergency room visits and hospitalizations, and lower overall costs of care; and 3) to fully participate in a collaborative multi-institution network designed to strengthen the research methods for evaluating natural experiments across all sites, and to advance the best analytic methods for natural experiments in the US research community. Our UCLA team will use quasi-experimental designs, de-identified data from UHC, and state-of-the-art modeling strategies to achieve these aims. Our team's 11 years of highly productive partnership with UHC, 19 years of experience evaluating policy-relevant natural experiments, most recently in the NEXT-D study, and 12 years of leading study coordination across national collaboratives, will help ensure our success.",1,,,,,1,,,ACO evaluation,1
20163012,The refined Health Action Process Approach for physical activity self-regulation in people with multiple sclerosis (MS),"This project evaluates an expanded and refined Health Action Process Approach (ReHAPA) model to promote physical activity (PA) for people with multiple sclerosis (MS). Physical activity (PA) has considerable benefits for people with MS, yet many persons with this immune-mediated disease of the central nervous system are physically inactive and sedentary. Recent evidence indicates that nearly 80% of people with MS are not meeting public health guidelines for moderate-to-vigorous PA, and PA levels further decrease over time in persons with relapsing-remitting MS. This information indicates that many people with MS are not benefiting from PA as a health promotion behavior, and accordingly may have increased risks of other comorbid conditions such as obesity, cardiovascular disease, and type II diabetes. ReHAPA is a theory-driven motivational model of PA promotion for people with MS. The model includes seven latent variables: antecedents of motivation, barriers and facilitators, multiphasic self-efficacy, motivation, props of volition, self-regulation skills, and PA. The study will provide useful information on motivational and volitional factors influencing PA behaviors in people with MS and findings can be used to design an effective PA intervention for people with MS.",1,1,,,,,,,motivation for PA among individuals with MS,1
20163093,Applying a system-based intervention to address barriers in the management of dysglycemia and diabetes in the hospital using electronic health records,"The burden of diabetes is increasing in epidemic proportions. Blood glucose abnormalities are common among hospitalized patients and are associated with poor clinical and economic outcomes. Despite evidence of effective strategies for inpatient glycemic control and the existence of clinical practice guidelines, inpatient glucose management remains suboptimal, and patients at risk or with unrecognized diabetes are frequently overlooked. The suboptimal recognition and management of diabetes in the hospital appears to be due to various factors beyond knowledge deficits among health care providers. Multiple barriers prevent optimal delivery of care. What predisposes to the persistence of these barriers is not clearly understood and represents a major gap in knowledge that this application will address. Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that the use of qualitative research methods, including clinical practice observations and interviews of health care providers, will identify what promotes the presence of gaps in diabetes care and will provide cues on how barriers can be corrected. Utilizing the knowledge derived from this innovative approach, coupled with recommendations derived by existing clinical practice guidelines, a novel electronic medical records-driven clinical decision support tool will be developed. Upon detection of a deficiency in the recognition and/or management of a dysglycemic episode, this tool will alert the medical staff and instruct them how to correct it. In aim 2 Dr. Pichardo-Lowden will create this novel tool and test its effectiveness in a pilot study. Based on its effect size, a large clinical trial will be appropriately powered. Aim 3 will consist of a clinical trial that will test the hypothesis that using such electronic medical record clinical decision support tool across intensive and non-intensive care units will reduce the incidence of hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia, increase detection of patients with or at risk for diabetes, improve documentation of diagnosis and glycemic status, improve inpatient diabetes care practice among providers, and reduce hospital length of stay and readmission rates. This K23 award will allow Dr. Pichardo-Lowden to acquire competency in qualitative research methods, integration of quality improvement strategies in health care, and public health sciences competency which will be essential to become an independent investigator in health care delivery in the area of diabetes. Dr. Pichardo-Lowden's long-term career goal is to study the long-term impact of the implementation of this clinical decision support tool in collaboration with other institutions by conducting a multicenter study and assess the impact of care in the following domains of clinical practice in a larger population: 1. early detection of diabetes, 2. inpatient care of diabetes and dysglycemia, 3. continuity of patient care, 4. modification of clinical practice behaviors among providers' users of the tool, 5. economic impact, and 6. inpatient morbidity and mortality. For this she plans to pursue extramural funding through an R01 or equivalent mechanism.",1,,,1,,,,,EMR decision support for blood glucose monitoing,1
20163205,Long-term benefits and risks of bariatric surgery in integrated care systems,"The epidemic growth of severe obesity continues unabated, and 36 million U.S. adults (14.5%) currently have a BMI >=35 kg/m2. In the last 20 years, bariatric procedures have emerged as the most effective interventions to induce weight loss and improvements in comorbidities. However, evidence about the long-term outcomes of bariatric surgery remains a critical gap. The proposed project will be the largest study to date to investigate the long-term relationships between bariatric surgery and durable improvements in body weight, hypertension, and renal disease, as well as its association with major operative complications and long-term survival. We will also compare these outcomes to a population-based cohort of severely obese patients who have not had weight loss surgery and investigate demographic and clinical characteristics (e.g., age, gender, race/ethnicity, bariatric procedure type, T2DM severity, and other comorbid medical and mental health conditions and their treatments) that may be associated with beneficial and adverse outcomes of surgery. Building upon methods that have been successfully applied in our prior studies, we will conduct a retrospective cohort study of more than 45,000 severely obese patients who underwent bariatric surgery in three large integrated health care systems over a 17-year period (1997-2013). This is the largest and most diverse bariatric population in the world with 41% racial/ethnic minority patients. Bariatric procedures and long-term outcomes will be identified from existing electronic medical record and registry databases using approaches that have been previously published or validated by members of our team. We will use advanced propensity-based statistical approaches to carefully identify a non-surgical comparison group with severe obesity. And we will investigate the potential for biases in our databases using a combination of primary data collection and chart review. These novel data will allow us to establish the validity of our outcome measures and establish whether subjects who have missing data in our databases have different long-term outcomes than those with complete data. The information gained from this study will enable physicians and patients to more accurately assess the long-term risks and benefits of bariatric surgical intervention and will help guide improvements in pre- and post-operative care pathways for bariatric patients. Our findings will also help improve the return on investment that health care systems are making in weight loss surgery.",1,1,,,,,,,bariatric procedures and outcomes,1
20163231,Statistical methods for health care in complex patients with diabetes,"Diabetes affects 8.3% of the US population, and leads to costly adverse health care outcomes. Unfortunately, there may be a quality gap in the care of complex diabetes patients--that is, older patients (age >65 years) and those with comorbid conditions. Current practices, relying primarily on the presence of several factors, are not effective in capturing the risk of poor prognosis, i.e., multiple hospitalization and/or emergency department visits, and death. Hence, little evidence exists so far to help prioritize care for these patients. The diabetes guidelines recognize that tight control of glycosylated hemoglobin (A1c) may not be appropriate for complex patients, and recommend individualizations in tight A1c control. However, neither the outcomes of tight A1c control, nor the effects of the typical treatment regimens used to achieve tight A1c control can be evaluated in clinical trials, with minimal, if any, enrollment of complex diabetes patients due to either their restrictive inclusion criteria or lack of encouragement of the patient and/or clinical investigator to consider the RCT. In order to deliver more effective, efficient, and accountable health care, it is important to help clinicians to examine the relationship between patient complexity and patients' A1c control level, and to modify guidelines appropriately with an evidence base. The proposed research will analyze a cohort of 8,304 Medicare beneficiaries with diabetes who were cared for by one of the country's 10 largest physician group practices, the University of Wisconsin Medical Foundation, during 2003-2011 to address the following aims: (1) to conduct risk prediction incorporating longitudinal outcomes, (2) to inform guidelines for complex diabetes patients, and (3) to create a patient-centered surveillance tool for detecting short-term negative outcomes. Our analytic approach involves the use of state-of-the-art statistics and machine learning methods to take advantage of the large electronic health records data. The proposed methods and results will help clinicians to identify and quantify risks of tight A1c control in complex diabetes patients and potentially lead to improved patient experiences, and reduce medical expenditures from excess adverse events.",1,1,,,,,,,risk of a1c control among complex diabetes patients,1
20163243,Assess social determinants using electronic health records (EHRs) in safety net clinics: diabetes outcomes,"Despite substantial evidence that individual- and neighborhood-level ""social determinants of health"" (SDH) negatively impact diabetes (DM)-related treatment and health outcomes, SDH data are insufficiently captured in most electronic health records (EHRs). Recognizing this, an Institute of Medicine (IOM) committee recently recommended a set of candidate SDH data domains for inclusion in all EHRs. Our team previously showed that SDH data can feasibly be documented in EHRs; the crucial next step will be to learn how to integrate and present SDH data in EHRs in clinically meaningful ways. Access to actionable information on SDH could give primary care teams a more complete understanding of the factors impacting patients' care and outcomes, and inform clinical decision making, panel management, and referrals to external services. The need for information on SDH is greatest in the health care safety net, whose vulnerable patients have more SDH-related risks, higher DM incidence, and worse DM outcomes than the general US population. Thus, we propose to assess how the IOM-recommended domains can most effectively be incorporated and presented in the EHR to optimize their clinical utility for DM prevention and care, through a cluster-randomized pragmatic trial in 20 CHCs. Using mixed methods, we will identify specific ways to modify existing SDH data documentation tools to more effectively integrate SDH data into DM prevention/care, optimize workflows, and support clinical decision making. We will enhance and adapt the SDH data tools based on these findings, through a user-centered design process, to optimize care teams' use of and acceptance of the tools. We anticipate creating enhanced SDH data tools that prompt specific clinical actions or referrals, augment panel management, and improve referral tracking capabilities, using proven clinical decision support (CDS) approaches. We will implement the adapted tools via a two-arm, randomized, staggered design. We will study integration of the SDH data into workflows, utilization of the data tools, and potential adverse outcomes. We will evaluate the impact of the implemented enhanced tools on DM-related clinical decision making, and on DM prevention, care, and health outcomes (e.g., rates of incident DM; BP, A1c, LDL), in a segmented time-series analysis. This work leverages established partnerships with OCHIN, Inc., the nation's leading developer of EHR tools for CHCs, and other community partners. These partnerships position study results to immediately inform SDH data documentation and use, and to yield lasting care improvements extending beyond DM. Our team includes diverse experts, IOM SDH committee members, and community clinicians. Our timely results will inform practice and policy related to integrating SDH data into clinical workflows in diverse care systems.",1,,,1,,,,,integration of social determinant factors (community) into EHRs (org),1
20163246,Enhancing self-management support in diabetes through patient engagement,"The patient-centered medical home (PCMH) and the chronic care model (CCM) are complementary clinical intervention frameworks that are commonly invoked to support better type 2 diabetes (T2DM) outcomes in primary care. Self-management support (SMS) is a core component of both the PCMH and CCM, and focuses on the central role of patients in managing their illness by engaging with and adopting healthy behaviors that promote optimal clinical outcomes. Despite its recognized importance, SMS programs for diabetes continue to demonstrate limited effectiveness in the real world of primary care. SMS is comprised of two complementary and interactive components: (1) patient engagement (e.g., the process of eliciting and responding to patients' emotions and motivations related to health behaviors); and (2) behavioral change tools (e.g., selecting specific goals, creating action plans). While several sophisticated SMS programs have been developed for T2DM, the vast majority are designed with a narrow focus on behavioral change tools, largely ignoring unique aspects of the patient context that drive and maintain health behavior. Considerable clinical research suggests that the addition of a structured, evidence-based program of patient engagement can maximize the effectiveness of SMS programs for patients with T2DM in primary care. To date, however, there has been no systematic study of the degree to which fully integrating enhanced patient engagement as part of SMS will increase the initiation and maintenance of behavior change over time, and for which kinds of patients enhanced patient engagement is essential. To address this gap, we propose to compare a state-of-the-art, evidence-based SMS behavior change tool program, called Connection to Health (CTH), with an enhanced CTH program that includes a practical, time-efficient patient engagement protocol, to create a program with an integrated and comprehensive approach to SMS, which we call ""Enhanced Engagement CTH"" (EE-CTH). The current study will directly test the added benefit of EE-CTH to CTH with regard to self-management behaviors and glycemic control in resource-limited community health centers, where vast numbers of patients with T2DM from ethnically diverse and medically vulnerable populations receive their care. We will use an effectiveness-implementation hybrid design, employing the RE-AIM framework to test these two SMS programs for T2DM. This will provide critical information that will support dissemination and implementation of effective SMS programs in resource-limited primary care settings, serving diverse and medically vulnerable populations with much to gain from improved SMS.",1,1,,,,,,,alternative versions of diabets self management support programs,1
20163250,Identification of patients with diabetes at high risk for treatment failure,"The overall goal of this project is to improve quality of care of patients with diabetes by identifying patients who may have particular difficulty reaching treatment targets and who could therefore potentially benefit from additional resources. Investigators propose to achieve this goal by developing a technology to accurately identify patients at high risk for not reaching blood glucose targets to enable cost-effective implementation of resource-intensive interventions that improve glycemic control in high-risk individuals. Improving blood glucose control in patients with diabetes could both improve their quality of life by reducing diabetes complications and decrease costs. Some patients that face particularly high barriers to glucose control may benefit from additional resources that are too expensive to apply to broad patient populations. However, it is not currently possible to identify patients at high risk of not being able to reach blood glucose targets with sufficient accuracy to make these interventions cost-effective. One reason for this is that a large fraction of critical information about the patients' functional status, social circumstances and other important factors that may present barriers to glucose control is only found in narrative documents, from which it is difficult to extract. Furthermore, the amount of information about any single patient in the medical record is enormous, and is impossible to process efficiently using standard analytical algorithms such as regression analysis. In the proposed project, investigators will combine two novel technologies--natural language processing of electronic provider notes and artificial intelligence technology Dynamic Logic--to help circumvent these challenges to build a high-accuracy model of risk of not being able to reach blood glucose targets in patients with diabetes. Natural language processing will identify key concepts documented in the provider notes and will help translate their text into a compendium of facts about the patient. Dynamic Logic makes use of a limited number of iterative approximations to reduce the complexity of a problem with multiple predictor variables from exponential to approximately linear. Utilization of Dynamic Logic will therefore allow greatly increasing the number of factors/variables that can be considered for the models for prediction of failure to reach glucose control, and ultimately improve their accuracy. Consequently, this translational multidisciplinary project will both advance our understanding of the risk factors for not being able to reach glucose control for patients with diabetes and assist in real-life implementation of interventions that can help lower their blood glucose, decrease the rate of diabetes complications, improve the patients' quality of life, and help control the rising costs of health care.",1,,,,,,1,1,data on lots of factors into one predictive model - no specification on levels of the factors,1
20163264,Limited competition for the continuation of the SEARCH for Diabetes in Youth cohort study (UC4),"SEARCH for Diabetes in Youth (SEARCH) is an ongoing, large, culturally diverse, multi-center and population-based epidemiological study of youth with diabetes. Initiated in 2000 and encompassing the major racial/ethnic groups in the U.S: non-Hispanic white, African American, Hispanic, Asian-Pacific Islander, and American Indian, SEARCH was designed to estimate the prevalence, incidence, and clinical presentation of diabetes in youth age < 20 years, by age, sex, race/ethnicity, and diabetes type (SEARCH Registry Study). Beginning in 2002, SEARCH recruited a series of incident cohorts representative of the diverse racial/ethnic, socioeconomic, and geographic base population, who were well characterized through a variety of surveys, physical, and laboratory assessments soon after diagnosis and followed them longitudinally (SEARCH Cohort Study). This proposal will continue longitudinal follow-up of the participants in the SEARCH Cohort Study to examine four specific aims: 1) to establish, compare, and contrast the burden (prevalence, incidence, progression, and clustering) of acute and chronic complications of diabetes, and explore the responsible risk factors and pathways among youth and young adults with type 1 and type 2 diabetes; 2) to explore, compare, and contrast processes of care (including barriers to care and quality of care) and their influence on quality of life among youth with type 1 and type 2 diabetes, as they transition from pediatric to adult care; 3) to conduct surveillance of mortality including cause of death in the SEARCH cohort; and 4) to maintain, supplement, and promote access to the SEARCH Cohort repository for biological specimens to conduct scientifically and logistically appropriate ancillary studies. Since there is an earlier onset and increasing rate of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes, the already high burden of diabetes to the individual and the nation will increase over time. Understanding the factors and pathways that contribute to this burden will provide the foundation to develop strategic interventions to limit individual morbidity and mortality and promote an effective, sustainable national health policy.",1,,,,,,1,,continuation of surveillance study,1
20163299,Improving Chronic Disease Management with Pieces (ICD-Pieces),"The growing number of patients who have chronic kidney disease (CKD), diabetes, and hypertension is a public health challenge. CKD, diabetes, and hypertension are three chronic medical conditions (CMCs) that increase morbidity, mortality, resource utilization, and costs. Among adults in the United States the prevalence of CKD has increased from 10 to 14% over the past two decades, and diabetes and hypertension are the two leading causes of CKD and end-stage renal disease. Important progress in identification of effective treatments for CKD, diabetes, and hypertension has been made, but there is a significant gap in translating these treatments to clinical practice. We have recently implemented a collaboratory primary care and nephrology care model at Parkland Health and Hospital System for patients with CKD in a predominantly minority population using a novel technology platform (Pieces--Parkland intelligent e-coordination and evaluation system) that allows us to leverage information from the electronic health record (EHR) to facilitate implementation of CKD care within primary care practices and medical homes in the community. In a study supported by NIDDK, we are already observing improvements in BP control with a collaborative care model using Pieces to identify people with CKD and assist implementing recommended practices. We have also used Pieces to successfully develop various risk prediction models for readmissions and deaths in collaborating large health care systems. We now propose a randomized pragmatic trial, Improving Chronic Disease Management with Pieces (ICD-Pieces), in four large health care systems to test our model of care for patients with multimorbidity. The main hypothesis is that patients with CKD, hypertension, and diabetes who receive care with a collaborative model of primary care-subspecialty care enhanced by novel information technology (Pieces) will have fewer hospitalizations, readmissions, CV events, and deaths than patients receiving standard medical care. During the planning phase (UH2), we will establish the collaboratory and complete preparations at all participating sites for the study. In the implementation phase (UH3), we will conduct the randomized clinical trial pragmatic trial across the four large health care systems in the collaboratory. Our trial is pragmatic and randomized with rigorous controls and tests the implementation of several accepted and well-characterized interventions, which will be coordinated and applied broadly to patients with CKD, hypertension, and diabetes to evaluate clinically relevant outcomes. Our study has clearly defined milestones. The four participating large health care systems have different organizational structures, utilize different EHR and serve very different patient populations. We anticipate that findings from our study will provide a framework for future clinical trials and to advance the care of patients with multiple chronic medical conditions.",1,,,1,,,,,collaborative care for chronic kidney disease,1
20173372,Worksite interventions to reduce obesity and diabetes risk in low socioeconomic status (SES) populations,"Attaining and maintaining healthy weight is a major public health goal for preventing diabetes. While intensive lifestyle interventions are successful in weight loss and reducing risk of diabetes, low socioeconomic status (SES) populations, which have a higher burden of obesity, are difficult to reach with health system or population-based weight loss interventions. The workplace offers a potentially effective setting for health promotion programs aimed at low SES populations. The proposed study team brings together nationally recognized research teams with complementary expertise in community-based obesity prevention and in workplace health and safety interventions to test a workplace intervention program targeted at low SES workers. Working in partnership with BJC HealthCare, a large health care employer with many low-wage workers, this project will evaluate modifiable work environment and individual-level barriers and facilitators of healthy eating and activity (aim 1). Guided by this formative work, the study team will adapt existing group- and individual-level intervention models to promote healthy weight among workers. We will develop and test an innovative multi-level intervention that includes an interactive obesity treatment program (iOTA) using SMS text messaging (aim 2B). This innovative mHealth intervention is embedded in a newly described Healthy Workplace Participatory Program, which incorporates employee participation in decision making to produce changes in the workplace environment that are acceptable, effective, and sustainable (aim 2A). These nested interventions will be tested in a large delayed-start group-randomized trial. This study will rigorously test readily scalable interventions that can be translated to other work settings to reduce obesity and diabetes risk among low SES workers, a group at high risk for these disorders. This pragmatic clinical trial will advance the long- term goal of enabling employers and employees to reduce obesity and obesity-associated illnesses, including diabetes.",1,1,1,1,,,,,adapted individual and group intervention to expand into the workplace,1
20182600,Worksite lifestyle program for reducing diabetes and cardiovascular risk in India,"Asian Indians have high rates of diabetes, prediabetes, and cardiometabolic risk factors. There is strong evidence that lifestyle change, particularly weight loss, increasing physical activity, and improving diet quality can prevent or delay diabetes, reduce cardiometabolic risk factors such as elevated glucose, plasma lipids, and blood pressure, and improve outcomes among individuals with diabetes. Implementing lifestyle change education and support at the worksite may be an effective and cost-effective method to deliver prevention in a way that is acceptable, accessible, and sustainable, and overcomes barriers to lifestyle change (e.g., lack of time or resources). Building off previous work by the international study team, this study proposes implementing and evaluating in a pre-post design trial the acceptability, delivery, effectiveness, and cost-effectiveness of a worksite-based lifestyle improvement package, including a peer-led lifestyle change education program augmented with changes in the worksite environment that promote social support, healthy eating, and exercise. The lifestyle education program will include 2000 adults with prediabetes (HbA1c of 5.7-6.4%) or unmedicated diabetes (HbA1c=6.5% identified at screening) across eight diverse worksites in India (changes to the worksite environment will impact a much broader population of employees). A mixed-methods approach will be used to evaluate implementation of the program. The study aims to measure (1) success of implementation in terms of program adoption (participation and changes in weight and diet and physical activity behaviors among lifestyle class participants); fidelity to the program (activities of study-affiliated worksite staff, changes to the food options at the worksite canteen, management support for the program, and changes in the worksite environment); and program acceptability as reported by employees, managers, supervisors, and lifestyle education program participants and dropouts during in-depth, semi-structured interviews and focus group discussions; (2) program effectiveness by evaluating the number of cardiometabolic risk goals reached for reductions in blood pressure, triglycerides, and HbA1c (the primary outcome) and through changes in secondary outcomes including rates of diabetes incidence and regression to normoglycemia and changes in anthropometry, lipids, and fasting glucose; and (3) value and return on the investment of the program for employers by assessing program costs, cost-effectiveness, and changes in staff productivity, absenteeism, health status, and quality of life. This project will deliver scientific innovations (lifestyle education programs with text message supports during maintenance) with social innovations (educated peer health educators delivering a program to a large at-risk population) and business innovation (worksite stakeholder commitment and partnering researchers to help deliver the program with fidelity, improve the workplace health environment, and evaluate the model). If the program is shown to be feasible, acceptable, effective, and cost-effective at these worksites, the program could be disseminated to other worksites throughout India and elsewhere.",1,1,1,1,,,,,peer led lifestyle change program in the workplace,1
20182602,Tools and practices to decrease cardiovascular disease (CVD) and complications in the diabetic population of Mexico,"The current proposed research will focus on the prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and its complications among adults with diabetes in Northern Mexico. One major component of the study will assess the effectiveness of an adapted evidence-based community health worker intervention, Meta Salud Diabetes, at reducing behavioral and clinical risk for cardiovascular disease among adults with diabetes in Sonora, Mexico. We will conduct a cluster randomized trial among adult patients with diabetes sampled from 20 Secretaria de Salud (Secretary of Health)-operated health centers in Sonora. Existing community health workers at each of ten health centers randomized to the intervention condition will be trained in the adapted CVD prevention curriculum. The community health workers will then enroll 20 participants with diabetes at each site into the 12-week intervention. Psychosocial (e.g., knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs) and behavioral (e.g., smoking, healthy eating) risk factors for cardiovascular disease will be assessed via self-administered surveys during the first of the 12 weekly educational sessions. Clinical risk factors (i.e., BMI, blood pressure, lipids, blood sugar) will be abstracted from existing patient records at the health centers. We will then assess changes that occur at three months (immediately after the 12-week intervention) and 12 months. Changes in the intervention clinic will be compared to changes over the same time period among adult patients with diabetes in each of ten health centers randomized to the control condition (i.e., the usual standard of care). We define the intervention effect as changes over time that occur among intervention participants net of changes over time among diabetic patients at control health centers. We further propose a second component of the study that will consist of systematic engagement of local, state, and national decision makers essential to scale up and sustain the intervention into the standard package of services offered by government-run health centers in Sonora and other Mexican states. These government-run health centers, like those where our cluster randomized trials are executed, represent an ideal system for scale-up of Meta Salud Diabetes and other evidence-based community health worker interventions, since most Mexicans are eligible and receive care at these health centers and because Mexico's centralized health care system will greatly facilitate system-wide integration. Extensive qualitative and descriptive data will be collected on the facilitators and barriers to adopt and integrate community health worker chronic disease interventions throughout Sonoran health centers and other health care systems serving high-risk populations in Mexico.",1,1,1,1,,,,,center-based community health worker intervention,1
20184024,PREVENT-D: Post ACA reform: evaluate community health center care for diabetes,"Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a prevalent and devastating chronic disease, affecting >29 million people in the United States (US). Health insurance and continued access to health care services are essential for optimal DM care and management; therefore, it is hypothesized that Affordable Care Act (ACA) Medicaid expansions could substantially improve access to health insurance and health care services for patients at risk for DM or already diagnosed with DM (""with DM risk or DM""). The ACA called for every state to significantly expand Medicaid coverage by 2014; little is yet known about the impact of ACA Medicaid expansion on the prevention, treatment, expenditures, and outcomes of patients with DM risk or DM. In a 2012 legal challenge, the US Supreme Court ruled that states were not required to implement ACA Medicaid expansions; thus (by January 1, 2015), 28 states and the District of Columbia expanded Medicaid, while 22 states did not. This ""natural experiment"" presents a unique opportunity to learn whether and to what extent Medicaid expansion can affect health care access and services for patients with DM risk or DM. We will use this unprecedented natural experiment to expand our understanding of how Medicaid expansion impacts DM prevention, treatment, expenditures, and health outcomes. We will use electronic health record (EHR) data from the ADVANCE clinical data research network (Accelerating Data Value Across a National Community Health Center Network), which has data from 718 community health centers (CHCs), including 470 CHCs in 12 Medicaid expansion states and 248 CHCs in 9 non-expansion states. From this dataset, we will collect detailed information on changes in health insurance, service receipt, and health outcomes, with data spanning 9 years (pre- and post-expansion), comparing states that expanded Medicaid, and those that did not. Moreover, building on our prior work, we will link EHR data from 213 Oregon ADVANCE CHCs to Oregon Medicaid claims data to assess Medicaid expenditures among patients with DM risk or DM. The specific aims are as follows: (aim 1) compare pre-post insurance status, overall visits, and chronic disease management visits among patients with DM risk or DM, in expansion versus non-expansion states; (aim 2) compare pre-post receipt of primary and secondary DM preventive services (e.g., screening for obesity, lipid levels, glycosylated hemoglobin) among patients with DM risk or DM, in expansion versus non-expansion states; (aim 3) compare pre-post changes in DM-related biomarkers (e.g., body mass index, blood pressure, lipid levels) in patients with DM risk or DM among newly insured (gained Medicaid in post-period), already insured (had Medicaid coverage in pre- and post-period), and continuously uninsured (pre- and post-period) patients in states that expanded Medicaid; and (aim 4) measure pre-post changes in Oregon Medicaid expenditures among newly insured compared to already insured patients with DM risk or DM. Findings will be relevant to policy and practice, informing further improvements in the US health care system to ensure access for vulnerable populations and mitigate disparities in DM prevention, treatment, and health outcomes.",1,,,,,1,,,medicaid expansion,1
20163040,Targeting family behaviors to improve diabetes management among adults with type 2 diabetes,"For adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), successful self-management requires daily self-care behaviors, which can be made easier or more difficult by family members' behaviors. Family members who perform diabetes-specific supportive behaviors (e.g., reminding patients to take medications, exercising with the patient) often also perform behaviors that make adults' self-care more difficult (e.g., sabotaging the patients' self-care attempts or nagging/arguing about self-care). Targeting family members' disease-specific behaviors may be effective for improving patients' adherence. However, few family interventions for adults with T2DM have been successful in improving patients' outcomes, and family interventions are often time-intensive and poorly attended by patients at highest risk of non-adherence (minority groups with low socioeconomic status; SES). It remains unclear whether intervention content can equip adult patients with the necessary skills to identify and manage supportive and obstructive diabetes-specific family behaviors. Furthermore, longitudinal evidence is conspicuously absent; we do not yet know if the relationships between family members' diabetes-specific behaviors and patients' diabetes management (i.e., adherence to self-care behaviors and glycemic control) are unidirectional or reciprocal over time. During this K01 award, the principal investigator (the candidate) will address these gaps in the extant literature while participating in a mentored training experience that will prepare her for success as an independent investigator who identifies sustainable approaches to family interventions that improve the health and well-being of adults with T2DM and their family members in at-risk populations. Specific training goals include developing expertise in family-focused intervention content for adults' diabetes management, behavioral randomized controlled trials (RCTs), delivering intervention content via mobile phone technology, and longitudinal analysis. The proposed plan integrates didactic coursework and training, a mentored research experience (including hands-on experience with an NIDDK R01-funded behavioral RCT), participation in local and national meetings/seminars/workshops/conferences, and active involvement in a robust and extremely supportive research environment. This environment includes NIDDK-funded Center for Diabetes Translational Research and Diabetes Research & Training Center, a NIH Clinical & Translational Science Award, a Center for Health Services Research, a Center for Health Behavior and Health Education, AHRQ-funded programming in patient-centered outcomes research, and the Meharry-Vanderbilt Community Engaged Research Core, which facilitates the active engagement of patients and community clinics in research. In addition, one of the candidate's co-mentors is the director of the multidisciplinary Consortium for Life-span BioBehavioral Family Health Research at the University of Utah, and will provide the candidate with access to associated resources and relevant collaborations. The proposed research includes three specific aims. Aim 1: The candidate will build on findings from her research with the target population (i.e., a racially/ethnically diverse, low SES patient population) to develop family-focused intervention content to equip patients with skills to ask for needed supportive behaviors from family members and to redirect and/or disengage from obstructive family behaviors. Intervention content will be delivered exclusively via basic mobile phone technology (i.e., text messages and voice communications) to enhance reach, participation, and retention. Adult T2DM patients and an adult family member will be recruited for three iterative rounds of usability testing to refine the intervention prior to evaluation. The intervention will be evaluated in a 3-month trial nested within her mentor's larger RCT. Aim 2: The candidate will analyze the extent to which changes in patients' diabetes self-efficacy, self-care behaviors, and glycemic control were occasioned by changes in family members' diabetes-specific behaviors (i.e., the targeted mechanism), and will evaluate the acceptability of delivering intervention content to family members via text messages. Aim 3: Finally, the candidate will analyze the longitudinal relationships between patient-reported diabetes-specific family behaviors and patients' self-care and outcomes, assessed at regular intervals over a 12-month period. This career development plan presents a natural extension of the candidate's research and training to date, and leverages findings from her NIDDK-funded F32 to inform the development of family interventions for adults with T2DM. Upon completion of this plan, the candidate will have expertise in developing and delivering family-focused behavioral intervention in a low SES patient population via technology and in using longitudinal data analysis to evaluate effects of intervention content on health behaviors and outcomes. In combination with findings from the specific aims, this unique expertise will accelerate the candidate's independent research career as an expert in family interventions for adults with T2DM, and will help her reach her ultimate goals of developing and evaluating scalable family interventions to improve health and quality of life for adults with T2DM and their family members.",1,,1,,,,,,family members diabetse specific behaviors,1
20163086,Enhancing patient activation in diabetes care using social and goal-based comparisons,"In the United States, diabetes is the leading cause of kidney failure, non-traumatic lower limb amputations, and new cases of blindness, and a major cause of heart disease and stroke. In addition, diabetes takes a large financial toll, resulting in $116 billion in medical expenditures annually. Meeting target health outcomes (such as HgbA1C values) set by national quality of care standards (e.g., American Diabetes Association Standards of Care) reduces complications. Despite the evidence supporting the importance of these guidelines, many patients have measures of diabetes health status that fall outside of these standards. Diabetes is a self-managed condition that requires patient involvement in planning and treatment. Patient activation (i.e., willingness and ability to take action to manage one's health and health care) is essential to achieving diabetes management that meets national quality of care standards and is associated with lower costs. While a growing number of intervention studies aim to increase patient activation, many limitations and gaps exist. Studies looking at the impact of web-based interventions have shown promise, but evidence of their efficacy is limited and controlled trials, in particular, are needed to identify effective, sustainable, and scalable strategies to increase patient activation and assist patients in effectively managing their diabetes. In hopes of more actively involving patients in their care, many health care organizations have begun to routinely provide patients access to laboratory test results, medication lists, and visit summaries through patient portals; some even provide unfettered access to the notes and other documents in the medical record. However, knowledge of one's actual and target health outcomes (such as HgbA1C values) alone has been insufficient in increasing the confidence and motivation necessary to improve patients' diabetes self-management, and strategies to provide information to patients must be combined with other behavioral strategies to motivate and help patients effectively manage their diabetes. The power of social and goal-based comparisons (i.e., comparisons of one's own status to the status of others as well as goal status) to influence behavior is well documented in a variety of settings. Despite evidence that social comparison information increases motivation and is central to the patient experience, it has been underutilized to motivate and maintain healthy behaviors in patients with diabetes and other chronic medical conditions. This proposal describes a career development plan that enables me to gain expertise in behavioral science and quality improvement research among patients with diabetes, develop a novel diabetes dashboard for patients that contains social and goal-based comparison information about their diabetes health status, and learn valuable health information technology and research methodology for future implementation studies. The specific aims of the research are (1) assess patients' attitudes, perceptions, and reactions to receiving information about their diabetes health status (e.g., HgbA1C, diabetic retinopathy screening status) relative to both national quality of care standards (i.e., goal-based information) as well as the diabetes health status of patient peers within the same medical practice (i.e., social comparison information); (2) develop an effective diabetes dashboard for patients to illustrate measures of their diabetes health status relative to both national quality of care standards as well as the diabetes health status of patient peers within the same medical practice; and (3) conduct a pilot, cluster randomized controlled trial (RCT) of the diabetes dashboard developed in aim 2. The career development plan integrates (a) advanced coursework in behavioral science, health information technology, and intervention research; (b) participation in local/national meetings; (c) a multidisciplinary mentored research experience; and (d) a highly supportive research environment. This environment includes an NIH-NIDDK funded Center for Diabetes Translation Research, a distinguished Department of Biomedical Informatics, an NIH-funded Clinical and Translational Science Award, and mentorship from internationally recognized experts in behavioral science, diabetes care, and quality improvement. Overall, this career development award will advance my career in diabetes-related behavioral and quality research. In addition, the award will provide critical support to guide translational studies/R01 applications. Future studies will (a) assess the impact of the dashboard on patient activation and cognitive, behavioral, and clinical outcomes in large RCT; (b) incorporate the dashboard into a patient portal and assess the user experience; and (c) determine whether financial incentives to patients for achieving or maintaining goal status on measures of diabetes health status contained in the dashboard is superior to the dashboard alone.",1,,1,,,,,,peer comparison in the EHR,1
20163144,Lifestyle and medication management to lower diabetes risk in severe mental illness,"Depression and type 2 diabetes are related pressing public health problems. Depression, antidepressant medications, and the health risk behaviors they are associated with are all risk factors for type 2 diabetes. The overarching goal of this study is to test the additive effects of two proven health interventions--lifestyle modification and medication therapy management--on risk for diabetes in persons with depression and functional impairment. Treatments will be delivered through our model designed for patients with mental illness (MI) whose care is challenged by distance, disability, language, and culture. Cambodian Americans are ideally suited for this research question because, compared to the general population and other Asian Americans, they have 1) high rates of diabetes and disability; 2) high rates of MI; 3) high rates of polypharmacy and medication problems; and 4) a worse profile of the social determinants of health. We will recruit 210 adult Cambodian Americans with major depressive disorder and associated impaired functioning, and who are at high risk for diabetes, from our network of community-based organizations in the northeast. Seventy participants each will be assigned to one of three arms. In the lifestyle arm, community health workers (CHWs) will deliver the lifestyle intervention during weekly-to-triweekly tapered group sessions and 5 individual home visits over 18 months. In the combination arm, in addition to lifestyle, a pharmacist will join the patient and CHW during home visits via telemedicine to deliver medication therapy management, during 5 home visits over 18 months. In the enhanced standard care arm, participants will receive their usual health care enhanced by supportive services. Participants will be assessed at baseline, 1 year, and 2 years. We hypothesize that 1) compared to enhanced standard care, the lifestyle intervention will produce greater improvements in depressive symptoms, medication adherence, objective physical activity, objective sleep quality, and nutrition; and 2) compared to either intervention alone, the combined treatment will improve insulin sensitivity, HbA1c, C-reactive protein, anthropmetrics, blood pressure, lipids, and depressive symptoms. If successful, these approaches may apply to other communities with barriers to care and produce diabetes prevention interventions for patients with MI.",1,1,1,,,,,,group and individual interventions examined,1
20163156,"Severe hypoglycemia: ascertainment, surveillance and pharmacovigilance","Most patients with type 2 diabetes are prescribed medications to lower glucose levels and reduce the risk of long-term complications. Severe hypoglycemia (SH) occurs as an unintended consequence of medications (i.e., an iatrogenic effect) and is defined as a low blood glucose level for which the patient requires assistance. SH is associated with poorer quality of life, serious falls, car accidents, ventricular arrhythmia, dementia, hospitalizations, and a several-fold increased risk of death. Despite advances in pharmacotherapy, SH leading to emergency department (ED) visits or hospitalization has emerged as one of the most prevalent complications of diabetes treatment and is a critical public health concern. One in four emergency hospitalizations for adverse drug events among older adults is due to SH. Yet, we lack sufficiently robust ascertainment tools to estimate the total incidence of SH. Despite increasing treatment complexity and prevalent polypharmacy, we also lack a reliable understanding of how SH risk changes when patients initiate combinations of glucose-lowering therapies or their interactions with non-diabetic drugs. We propose to study SH in a large (n~229,000), diverse cohort of adults with type 2 diabetes from an integrated health care delivery system (Kaiser Permanente Northern California or KPNC) with these three specific aims. In aim 1, we will develop and validate novel algorithms for identifying SH from EMR data (ED and hospital). Using these EMR coding algorithms, we will conduct comprehensive surveillance of trends in clinically recognized SH. We will also estimate the proportion of SH not clinically recognized (based on linkage with self-reported SH from a previous survey), which will facilitate calculation of the total rates of SH. In aim 2, we will quantify the change in risk of SH associated with initiation of medications commonly used by people with diabetes (i.e., examining the effect of diabetes medications, non-diabetes medications, or their interactions), using rigorous, causal modeling techniques (e.g., difference-in-difference analysis, marginal structural models, directed acyclic graphs). In aim 3, we will estimate whether the change in SH risk associated with initiation of medications (from aim 2) differs substantively across specific risk subgroups (e.g., prior SH, CKD, long duration diabetes, the elderly), and by baseline and changes in HbA1c. This study will 1) provide new SH ascertainment tools to improve surveillance nationwide and thereby enable a more comprehensive understanding of SH epidemiology; and 2) provide valid estimates of change in SH risk associated with initiation of medications commonly used by people with diabetes, thus helping providers and patients individualize diabetes management while minimizing the risk of SH.",1,,,,,,1,,algorithms for identifying hypoglycemia from EHR data,1
20163238,Diabetes screening and care received by the mentally ill in an integrated system,"This application for Small Grants for New Investigators to Promote Diversity in Health-Related Research (R03) will provide support for Dr. Christina Mangurian, a Latina psychiatrist at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), based at San Francisco General Hospital (SFGH). Dr. Mangurian will conduct research to examine diabetes screening and care received by a racially and ethnically diverse, insured population with severe mental illness served within an integrated health care delivery system. Dr. Mangurian has assembled a multidisciplinary team to facilitate her research. She has partnered with the director of the NIDDK-funded Center for Diabetes Translational Research (CDTR), Dr. Julie Schmittdiel, based at the Kaiser Permanente Northern California Division of Research. Her UCSF co-investigator, Dr. Dean Schillinger, is chief of the UCSF Division of General Internal Medicine at SFGH and has international expertise in diabetes research and health disparities. Their expertise will be complemented by Dr. Eric Vittinghoff, a UCSF biostatistician; Dr. Constance Weisner, a UCSF mental health services researcher; and two NIMH-funded collaborators with expertise in health screening among people with severe mental illness, Drs. Susan Essock and John Newcomer. People with severe mental illnesses (e.g., schizophrenia, bipolar disorder) die, on average, 25 years earlier than the general population, most often from cardiovascular disease. The antipsychotic medications used to treat this population are one major culprit because they increase the risk of diabetes and other metabolic abnormalities. Unfortunately, almost 10 years after publication of national screening guidelines, 70% of the people receiving these medications remain unscreened for diabetes and pre-diabetes. Small studies suggest minorities with severe mental illness are particularly susceptible to metabolic side effects from the antipsychotic medications, making screening of this high-risk subpopulation particularly important. Unfortunately, examination of this vulnerable population has been challenging because of the fragmentation of the physical and medical health care systems, particularly with respect to the acquisition of laboratory results. There is an urgent need to understand targets for interventions to improve the care of this vulnerable population. Therefore, in aim 1, Dr. Mangurian proposes to determine the diabetes screening rates among a diverse population with severe mental illness who receive services at an integrated care delivery system. In aim 2, she will estimate the prevalence of diabetes and pre-diabetes among diverse populations with severe mental illness. In aim 3, she will determine the proportion of people with co-morbid diabetes and severe mental illness receiving evidence-based diabetes care. The results of this research will identify patient-, provider-, and system-level targets to help guide and design an intervention to close the diabetes screening and care gaps for minorities with severe mental illness in a subsequent R01 application.",1,1,,,,,,,rates of diabetes among those with severe mental illness,1
20182604,Self-management behaviors among chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients with multi-morbidity,"Outcomes for patients with multi-morbidity (MM) are often poor, in part because of low adherence to self-management behaviors (SMB). Research has identified key determinants of SMB for individual diseases and shown the powerful influence that illness representations and medication beliefs have on these behaviors. Yet, little is known about the impact of illness representations in the context of MM where beliefs about one illness and its treatments may be at odds, or symbiotic, with those for comorbidities. Without this knowledge, our ability to provide optimal self-management support for MM patients is limited. The goal of this study is to determine how beliefs about chronic illness and their treatments affect SMB in the context of MM and to translate this information into self-management support counseling modules for use in future interventions. We will focus on patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), a disabling and costly health problem, and evaluate the impact of 3 comorbid conditions that differ in level of self-management complexity and symptomatology: hypertension (HTN), diabetes (DM), and depression. The study design is rooted in the self-regulation model (SRM), a theory of health behaviors that has been used to develop interventions, but has only been applied to research on behaviors around single diseases. Depression is of great interest in the study of the SRM because patients with depression often have maladaptive representations and perceptions of illness. By understanding the interplay of illness representations and medication beliefs and their impact on SMB in the context of comorbidities, we will advance both the SRM and the clinical care of patients with MM. The specific aims are to 1) examine the interactive effects of COPD-, HTN-, and DM-related cognitive and emotional illness representations and medication beliefs on patients' self-management of these conditions over time; 2) assess the association of major depression with COPD SMB over time and evaluate the pathways, via illness representations and medication beliefs, mediating this relationship; and (3) guided by findings from aims 1-2 and the SRM, develop and pilot test education and counseling modules for COPD patients with MM to promote adherence to SMB. We will conduct a mixed-methods prospective cohort study of 400 COPD patients with HTN or DM in New York City and Chicago and interview them every 3 months for 15 months. We will also conduct interviews during and after COPD exacerbations to assess changes illness representations and their impact on SMB. For aim 3, we will conduct qualitative interviews with patients who have good or low medication adherence to understand cognitive processes that guide SMB and to identify the self-management strategies they use. We will then create counseling modules to improve self-management and pilot them among 100 patients. The study will expand the SRM to MM, elucidate how patients respond to varying beliefs in the context of MM, and provide prototype self-management support counseling modules for application to a future, fully developed intervention to improve SMB and outcomes for adults with MM.",1,1,,,,,,,mtoivation for self management behaviors,1
20183337,Women in control: a virtual world study of diabetes self-management,"The prevalence of diabetes mellitus (DM) in the US is disproportionately high among minority women. In order to participate as partners in health care, DM patients need self-management education and support. Diabetes self-management (DSM) support is effective in helping DM patients make good choices and achieve clinical goals but is difficult to deliver in medical practice settings. Virtual reality technology can assist DM patients and their clinical teams with DSM support by providing effective educational tools in an engaging, learner-centered context that fosters self-efficacy and skill proficiency. Our prior work demonstrated that virtual worlds, like Second Life (SL), are suitable for supporting DSM education for patients. SL, an Internet-based virtual world, is an example of an immersive, three-dimensional environment which supports social networking and interaction with information. We now aim to enhance our curriculum using a medical group visit design to study whether the Women in Control virtual world group medical visit leads to similarly effective health and educational outcomes compared to face-to-face group medical visits. Our aims are to conduct a randomized, controlled trial of the comparative effectiveness of a virtual world DSM group medical visit format vs. a face-to-face DSM group visit format to increase physical activity and improve glucose control among black/African American and Hispanic women with uncontrolled DM at six-month follow-up, and to conduct a qualitative, ethnographic study of participant engagement with the virtual world platform during the virtual world group sessions, between group sessions, and following completion of the eight-week curriculum to characterize learners' self-directed interactions with the technology platform and assess the correlation of these interactions with DSM behaviors and diabetes control.",1,1,1,,,,,,second life vs. group sessions,1
20191463,"""Don't know"" responses to risk perception questions: identifying mechanisms and solutions","Strategies to change risk perceptions are models of health decision making. Both are based on an assumption that may not always be true--that individuals know their risk for a given illness. Preliminary work from our and other laboratories has shown that a non-trivial portion of the population is uncertain about their risk for common illnesses. Moreover, we have shown that uncertainty about one's illness risk is particularly likely among U.S. populations who suffer the burden of health disparities. However, the mechanisms underlying risk uncertainty remain unknown, which limits our ability to develop effective intervention strategies to change behavior, especially in those who remain uncertain about their risk despite the widespread dissemination of risk-based health messaging. The objective for this R01 program of research is to explicate the mechanisms leading individuals to answer ""do not know"" in response to risk perception questions. In a program of research encompassing both observational and experimental work, we will examine how factors relating to knowledge and health literacy, as well as factors related to defensive information avoidance, influence do not know responding. This objective will be achieved by addressing two specific aims: 1) to explore two distinct, theoretically informed explanations for do not know responding, and 2) to test whether experimentally manipulating the mechanisms hypothesized to cause do not know responding reduces do not know responding. Aim 1 will be achieved with a national survey examining if low health literacy and defensive risk information avoidance are related to do not know responding to colorectal cancer and type 2 diabetes risk perception items. Achieving aim 2 will be accomplished by experimentally testing 1) whether giving do not know responders with low health literacy health messages tailored to a low health literacy audience increases risk knowledge and reduces do not know responding; and 2) whether giving do not know responders who tend to avoid health information the opportunity to self-affirm prior to receiving health messages increases attending to, and comprehension of, these messages and reduces do not know responding. This research is significant in that it examines a key but understudied phenomenon related to a central decision making and behavior change construct--uncertainty about perceived risk for illness. Successful completion of the proposed research will generate tested strategies for developing more effective behavior change messages for individuals who are uncertain about their risk for common illnesses. Given the degree to which uncertainty about illness risk is more common in groups experiencing health disparities populations, our work has the potential to address behavior change factors that contribute to these ongoing health disparities.",1,1,,,,,,,health literacy  ,1

In addition, Dr. Flory has two key collaborators: Dr. Joshua Richardson, an expert in the application of qualitative research to biomedical informatics, and Dr. David Brillon, an endocrinologist and clinical researcher specializing in diabetes. The motivating clinical problem for this proposal is the fact that although metformin is the first-line drug therapy for T2DM and confers unequalled long-term clinical benefits, it is under-utilized. In particular, 16% of patients discontinue metformin at 6 months and close to a third discontinue it at one year. Dr. Flory's central hypothesis is that much of this non-persistence (i.e., early discontinuation) is due to patient-centered factors specific to metformin and that better prescribing practices and prescriber-patient communication can enhance metformin persistence. To test this hypothesis and translate it into a pragmatic intervention, Dr. Flory proposes to collect epidemiologic and qualitative data on metformin non-persistence and then design and pilot an intervention in a small pragmatic clinical trial. These activities will lay the groundwork for a large-scale pragmatic randomized trial to be proposed in an R01 application during the K08 award period. Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that metformin non-persistence is common and leads to observably worse short-term clinical outcomes. Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that non-persistent patients and their providers will offer potentially modifiable reasons for metformin non-persistence. Aim 3 will test the hypothesis that a pragmatic clinical trial of a patient-centered intervention to reintroduce metformin to previously non-persistent patients is feasible and likely to result in increased appropriate use of metformin to treat T2DM. The proposed research is significant because positive results will lead to identification of an intervention to allow more patients to benefit from metformin. Negative results would provide information on the nature of metformin non-persistence and lay groundwork for alternative approaches to optimizing care of these patients.",1,1,,,,,,,patient-centered intervention to increase med adherence,1
20154271,Understanding diabetes self-management behaviors among indigenous adults,"Background: American Indians (hereafter: Indigenous) have higher rates of diabetes and diabetes-related complications than the general population. It is important for individuals with diabetes to engage in diabetes self-management behaviors (DSMB) to prevent complications and enhance outcomes, and many different social and individual determinants impact the likelihood of performing these behaviors. Despite the breadth of literature investigating factors influencing DSMB, little information describes these behaviors among Indigenous individuals with type 2 diabetes (T2D), and no data were found regarding culturally specific factors impacting them. Aims: The purpose of this study is to determine factors influencing DSMB of Indigenous individuals who are recently diagnosed with T2D. Methods: This cross-sectional study will utilize an adapted form of Andersen's Behavioral Model to examine the predisposing and enabling characteristics impacting DSMB in five upper Midwest Indigenous tribal communities. Participants will be randomly selected from clinic records if they identify as American Indian, are over the age of 18, and have been diagnosed within the past two years with T2D. A total of 256 individuals will be invited to participate. Participants will complete computer-assisted personal interviews (CAPI). Data analysis will include descriptive statistics, bivariate correlations, regression models, and structural equation modeling. Expected outcomes: This research will enhance the knowledge of rates of engagement in DSMB, and elucidate the factors influencing these behaviors. Results will facilitate future planning of both provider- and community-based interventions to address barriers and facilitators of DSMB. Understanding the complex relationship between individual- and community-level factors will provide impetus for socio-ecological interventions aimed at multiple levels of determinants.",1,1,1,1,1,,,,assess factors based on the andersen and aday model (which is all levels of the SEM),1
20162078,Improving management strategies for blood pressure and lipids in pediatric type 1 diabetes (T1D),"Hypertension and dyslipidemia are undertreated in youth with type 1 diabetes (T1D), contributing to the risk of later macrovascular and microvascular diabetes complications. The research focus of this career development award is to improve the management of hypertension and dyslipidemia in these high-risk youth. In specific aim 1, Dr. Katz will conduct focus groups to solicit patient and family perspectives on barriers to and strategies for the effective management of hypertension and dyslipidemia with lifestyle changes or medications. She will also field a national survey to pediatric diabetes care providers to obtain their perceptions of their own barriers to and strategies for the management of hypertension and dyslipidemia in youth with T1D. In specific aim 2, Dr. Katz will use this information to create and pilot a family-focused, modular intervention designed to improve knowledge of and self-efficacy for hypertension and dyslipidemia management in youth with T1D. Michelle Katz, MD, MPH, the primary investigator on this career development award, has a strong background in clinical and health services research, but requires further career development to develop into a successful, independent investigator. Dr. Katz has assembled a multidisciplinary team of nationally recognized leaders in pediatric diabetes, diabetes behavioral research, lipid management in diabetes, epidemiology, and biostatistics to guide her as she conducts all phases of her proposed research. She has described a comprehensive career development plan that will enhance her research background and deepen her methodological expertise to allow her to rigorously accomplish her stated aims. The proposed career development plan utilizes the stimulating, resource-rich environments available through the Joslin Diabetes Center and Harvard University. Dr. Katz's research objectives will lead to important knowledge about how to effectively manage hypertension and hyperlipidemia in youth with T1D. By conducting these studies, working closely with her mentors, and completing her educational objectives, Dr. Katz will have the knowledge and the experience to embark on her chosen career as an independent clinical and health services investigator focused on improving health care delivery in pediatric T1D with the goal of reducing future diabetes complications.",1,,1,,,,,,family perspectives on barriers to self management of t1d in youth,1
20163131,A stepped-care behavioral intervention trial for young children with type 1 diabetes (T1D),"The incidence of type 1 diabetes (T1D) in young children (age <6 years) is rising. Disease management guidelines offered by the ADA and other diabetes care organizations place a high burden of responsibility onto these children's parents and caregivers to check blood sugar, administer insulin, and monitor diet and physical activity to maintain tight glycemic control. Unfortunately, this occurs at a vulnerable time in life when children's behavior is unpredictable, their T1D is difficult to control, parenting stress is elevated, and caregivers are strained by normal child caretaking routines. T1D education and support tends to be highly concentrated at diagnosis/during the inpatient stay, and requires rapid knowledge and skill acquisition on the part of parents. Not all families respond equally well to this teaching model, and many need more guided practice, problem-solving assistance, and behavioral supports than can be offered in a one-size-fits-all patient education approach. Our research will attempt to better meet the needs of individual families through a clinical behavioral stepped-care intervention for T1D in parents of young children by using real-time glycemic control and parental depression indices to intensify management support when indicated. Primary caregivers of young children (<6 years) newly diagnosed with T1D will be randomized to either a 3-step stepped-care (treatment) or usual care (comparison) condition. Stepped-care components include T1D management support delivered by trained lay parent consultants (step 1), T1D parenting strategies and mealtime behavior management delivered by bachelor's level behavioral assistants (step 2), and individualized diabetes education/management planning with a certified diabetes nurse educator and consultation with a diabetes team clinical psychologist (step 3). Biomedical and psychosocial measurements (including A1c, depressive symptoms, mealtime behavior, parenting stress, quality of life) will occur at baseline and 3-month intervals for up to 15 months post-diagnosis. The results of this work will ultimately lead to a more practical approach to T1D education and management that can be translated more easily into a variety of clinical practice settings to support young children's T1D management.",1,,1,,,,,,support for caregivers of youth with t1d,1
20163241,Physiologic insulin therapy for the management of hyperglycemia in the hospital,"More than 30% of general hospital inpatients experience episodes of hyperglycemia. These individuals suffer more in-hospital complications, longer stays, and higher treatment costs. To prevent these adverse effects, many hospitals, including the applicant institution, have introduced physiologic insulin treatment protocols (also referred to as ""basal-bolus therapy"") intended to maintain blood glucose within a specified range. Physiologic insulin therapy includes multiple daily injections to cover insulin needs: basal (overnight fasting and between-meal), prandial (glucose excursions above basal at mealtime), and correction (supplemental insulin, as needed to correct hyperglycemia). Current national guidelines recommend physiologic insulin--and discourage a traditional sliding scale regimen (correction component only) or oral agents--but the guidelines note that beneficial effects of the therapy on clinical outcomes and hospital resource use have not been proven in the general inpatient setting. A recent systematic review of the pertinent literature came to the same conclusion, emphasizing the need for further research before routinely incorporating intensive forms of glycemic control in a general inpatient population. Since strategies to control hyperglycemia lead to potentially dangerous episodes of hypoglycemia in 1 of every 12 inpatients, sometimes causing seizures, coma, brain injury, or death in severe cases, it is critically important to demonstrate the benefits of this approach before accepting it as a hospital-wide standard of care. The primary aim of the proposed study is to determine if physiologic insulin therapy administered to general hospital in-patients with hyperglycemia favorably affects in-hospital complications and mortality, need for intensive care, or length of stay. The secondary aim is to determine if the magnitude of benefit derived from this therapy differs (a) in patients with known vs. newly diagnosed diabetes or (b) in medical vs. surgical patients. The study will analyze data from a natural experiment that occurred when the applicant institution introduced universal physiologic insulin therapy as the standard of care for hyperglycemia. A quasi-experimental before-and-after study will compare in-hospital complications, mortality, and resource use in patients with comorbid type 2 diabetes before vs. after implementation of this standard (n~6400). Outcomes measured at seven nearby acute-care teaching hospitals during the same two time intervals will provide parallel control data (n~35,000). Data from the control hospitals will make it possible to evaluate whether temporal changes in patient characteristics or other variables affecting hospitals in the region could explain effects that might otherwise be erroneously attributed to the intervention. Given the high prevalence of comorbid diabetes in the hospital and the possibility that universal physiologic insulin for managing hyperglycemia may not deliver the intended benefit or could even do more harm than good, answering this question is an important goal.",1,,,1,,,,,univesal insulin administration in hospitals,1
20154080,Engaging veterans and family supporters in Patient-Aligned Care Teams (PACT) to improve diabetes management,"Background: Veterans with diabetes must control cardiovascular risk factors in order to prevent disabling and life-threatening complications. However, despite system-wide advances in diabetes quality of care, over 30% of VHA patients with diabetes continue to have uncontrolled blood pressure, hyperglycemia, or hyperlipidemia. The nationwide VA PACT (Patient-Aligned Care Teams) initiative seeks to provide patients comprehensive, team-based support for following diabetes care regimens. PACT's success, however, hinges on its ability to effectively engage patients in care. One relatively untapped resource for supporting engagement in PACT is the patients' family and friends. Three out of four adults with diabetes reach out to an unpaid family member or friend (a ""Care Partner"") for ongoing help with diabetes management. These supporters help patients with medication adherence, tracking home glucose measurements, maintaining a healthy eating plan, and they often accompany patients to their medical visits. However, while PACT emphasizes the importance of family members as part of the care team, PACT does not have formal mechanisms to involve health supporters in PACT care. Health supporters report that, in order to be more effective, they need more information on patients' medical care plans, clear channels for communicating with PACT team members, and information on navigating PACT resources. Objectives: The overall objective of this randomized trial is to test a strategy to strengthen the capacity of supporters to help patients with high-risk diabetes engage in PACT care and successfully enact care plans. The central hypothesis is that providing health care engagement tools to both Care Partners and patients will increase patient activation and improve management of diabetes complication risks. Methods: This will be a randomized controlled trial evaluating an intervention (Caring Others Increasing EngageMent in PACT, or CO-impact) designed to structure and facilitate health supporter involvement in PACT so that patients can become more actively engaged in PACT care. 240 patients with diabetes receiving PACT primary care who 1) are at high risk for diabetes complications due to hyperglycemia OR high blood pressure, and 2) have a health supporter involved in their care will be recruited along with their health supporter. Patient-supporter dyads will be randomized to the CO-impact intervention or usual PACT care for high-risk diabetes for 12 months. The intervention provides patient-supporter dyads: one coaching session on action planning, communicating with providers, navigation skills and support skills; preparation by phone before patients' primary care visits; after-visit summaries by mail; and biweekly automated phone calls to prompt action on new patient health concerns. CO-impact builds on medical record-integrated patient activation tools in the PACT toolkit and is designed to be implementable within existing PACT nurse encounters. Primary outcomes for this study include a validated measure of patient activation (Patient Activation Measure-13) and a cardiac event 5-year risk score designed for patients with diabetes (UKPDS Risk Engine). Secondary outcomes include patients' self-efficacy for diabetes self-care; diabetes self-management behaviors including medication adherence; diabetes distress; and glycemic and blood pressure control. Measures among supporters include supporter activation, use of effective support techniques, distress about patient's diabetes care, and caregiver burden. We will also measure patient-supporter and patient-provider relationship quality, patient safety (e.g. hypoglycemia), utilization, potential moderators of intervention effect such as patient health literacy level, and facilitators and barriers to wider implementation. Findings: This study has not yet begun recruitment. No findings statement. Impact: If successful, the study will establish a new approach for involving patients' supporters in VA care, in ways that could avert devastating consequences of uncontrolled diabetes. Similar methods could be used by the VA to better support veterans' family caregivers, and to improve health management for veterans with other high-risk conditions.",1,,1,1,,,,,"patient care teams, patient family and friends",1
20154240,Patient-centered data visualizations for diabetes,"Type 1 diabetes is associated with information deluge. Individuals are collecting enormous amounts of data, including glucose, insulin, and carbohydrate data, yet the extent to which this information is being utilized for developing insights about self-management in diabetes is limited. The majority of patients do not utilize data visualization displays in their self-management, as most data displays are static and often display blood glucose numbers without providing additional information or insights related to the data visualization. There are a variety of new information tools and technologies that facilitate exploration and examination of multiple streams of longitudinal data using interactive visualization techniques. However, most of these displays are used outside of the healthcare setting, have not been evaluated for usability or understanding, and have not had a specific focus on the patient as the user. In addition, with the advent of smartphone technology, there are many additional data streams that are relevant for understanding self-management in diabetes that are easily passively collected, including physical activity levels and physical location, a proxy for environment. However, these additional displays are not traditionally included in data displays for diabetes. Adolescents with type 1 diabetes are the ideal population for innovating a novel personalized data visualization system that integrates large amounts clinical data with contextual data collected from mobile phones using GPS and accelerometry, provides interactive visualizations that tell a story and are engaging, and provides opportunities for greater engagement, insight, and problem solving for improving glycemic control and overall health outcomes. Success of this prototype will lead to advances in interactive health visualizations, advances in interactive technologies for engagement, and the rise of the patient as expert, working in partnership with the healthcare system to improve health.",1,1,,,,,,,personalized data visualization for individuals,1
20154251,An integrated closed-loop feedback system for pediatric cardiometabolic disease,"Cardiometabolic disease-a clustering of medical conditions and risk factors which includes obesity, diabetes, impaired liver function, and an increased risk in children for adult-onset cardiovascular disease-represents a major population-wide health burden in the United States. Management of cardiometabolic disease also imposes a substantial financial burden on the economy and ties up significant healthcare resources. It is well known that many of the lifestyle and health behaviors that contribute to cardiometabolic disease are difficult to modify once established, and childhood represents an opportune time for promoting healthy behaviors. Patient-centered outcomes research (PCOR) has identified certain health behaviors as important and actionable in modifying cardiometabolic risk, namely weight management, physical activity, screen time, sleep, and consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages. Mobile health technology (mHealth) could be used to monitor and counsel on common health behaviors associated with cardiometabolic risk, which may facilitate the inclusion of PCOR evidence on cardiometabolic disease into clinical practice. The overall goal of this research is to use mHealth technology to accelerate the uptake of PCOR findings on treatment of cardiometabolic disease. To achieve our goal, this study will develop a novel set of mHealth tools capable of collecting health behavior information and determine to what extent providing clinical feedback on these health behaviors improves obesity and health behaviors among children ages 2-12 years and their families. In this study we will develop, implement, and test the comparative clinical effectiveness of a closed-loop feedback system for collecting patient data and providing recommendations. The specific aims of this study are 1) to develop an integrated closed-loop feedback system that incorporates longitudinal mHealth data in managing cardiometabolic disease among at-risk families; and 2) to determine the extent to which an integrated closed-loop system that provides feedback on objective patient-generated data improves cardiometabolic risk, as measured by changes in body mass index and health behaviors, including physical activity, screen time, sleep, and sugar-sweetened beverage consumption. This research will develop novel mHealth tools and approaches that will allow healthcare providers and patients to better understand disease risk and improve disease management by collecting patient data 1) repeatedly over time, 2) simultaneously, and 3) objectively. This study is innovative because it will use mHealth tools to simultaneously collect longitudinal data on multiple health behaviors known to be associated with cardiometabolic risk, and it will offer a new approach to implementing and disseminating PCOR findings via a novel closed-loop feedback system. The high prevalence of cardiometabolic disease makes this innovative closed-loop system very relevant to public health. The mHealth tools and methods developed by this study for collecting patient data and providing clinical feedback could also easily be adapted and applied to a range of other health conditions.",1,,,1,,,,,closed loop feedback system for patient care,1
20161285,Systems for helping veterans comprehend electronic health record notes,"Background: As part of its commitment to patient-centered care, the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) is providing veterans with comprehensive access to their personal health information. In January 2013, the VHA began to make clinical notes in the electronic health records (EHR) available through the My HealtheVet portal. Access to such information can increase transparency, communication between clinicians and patients, and patient involvement in self-management of care. However, many studies have shown that patients are confused by EHR notes, especially patients in vulnerable groups (e.g., low literacy, low income). Significant barriers to patients' understanding their clinical notes include use of specialized medical terminology and lack of explanations for complex concepts. Veterans who have limited health literacy are likely to have difficulty understanding their clinical notes. Objectives: We will develop and evaluate NoteAid, a natural language processing (NLP) system that links medical jargon in clinical notes to consumer-oriented concepts, definitions, and educational materials in order to help veterans comprehend their EHR notes. Our specific aims are to (1) develop a comprehensive health knowledge resource by integrating clinical vocabularies and abbreviations, and linking medical concepts and corresponding lay concepts, definitions, and education materials; (2) develop a sophisticated NLP system for identifying medical concepts and abbreviations from EHR notes and for linking EHR notes to education materials; and (3) evaluate NoteAid and assess improvement of patients' comprehension of EHRs, their communication with caregivers, and their clinical knowledge and self-management. Methods: Using diagnostic codes, we will create a cohort of EHR notes from veterans who have been diagnosed with diabetes, hypertension, or hyperlipidemia. Using this EHR cohort data, we will develop NoteAid. We will then evaluate NoteAid by conducting a randomized comparison trial with 250 veterans from the Edith Nourse Rogers Memorial Veterans Hospital (ENRM). We propose a between-subject randomized experiment comparing those subjects exposed to clinical notes only versus those exposed to clinical notes plus NoteAid. The baseline interview assessment at ENRM will include the identification of chronic conditions, age, education, gender, and a literacy measure. Outcomes measures will assess comprehension, patient activation, and communication with care providers. Two subsequent interviews, including the outcome assessments, will follow during a six-month time frame. Each veteran will receive a $75 honorarium for participation ($40 for the initial visit and $35 for completing the follow-up interviews). Veterans consented but not enrolled will be given an honorarium of $10. We will conduct quantitative analyses of the outcome measures. Bivariate statistics and regression analyses will be utilized. Equal emphasis will be given to both negative and positive findings of equal scientific merit. Results of the study will be disseminated through the eHealth QUERI across the VA system. We will report best practices and create a repository of material, consulting with national-level My HealtheVet implementation and education managers. Findings: Physician feedback was mixed. Positive feedback on NoteAid included (1) easy to use, (2) good visual display, (3) satisfactory system speed, and (4) adequate lay definitions. Opportunities for improvement arising from evaluation sessions and feedback included (1) improving the display of definitions for partially matched terms, (2) including more medical terms in CoDeMed, (3) improving the handling of terms whose definitions vary depending on different contexts, and (4) standardizing the scope of definitions for medicines. On the basis of these results, we have improved NoteAid's user interface and a number of definitions, and added 4502 more definitions in CoDeMed. Impact: Work has continued on natural language processing development. Research staff have utilized population-level rankings of terms in EHRs to expand a lay language resource that supports patient EHR comprehension. Adapted distant supervision was used to rank terms pulled from EHR notes and prioritize concepts. This work also helped to develop FIT (Finding Important Terms), a system that helps tailor information to each individual patient's needs. Work has also been conducted that explores the relationship between readability scores and patients' perceived difficulty of text in EHR notes, and physician evaluation of the NoteAid system helped refine content and improve system operability.",1,1,,1,,,,,"natural language processing, patient EHR use",1
20173401,"Strong Men, Strong Communities: cultural tradition to improve Native men's health","American Indian (AI) males experience profound health disparities compared to their counterparts in all other U.S. racial and ethnic groups. For example, AI men have the highest age-adjusted prevalence of type 2 diabetes (~18 percent) among U.S. men, while non-Hispanic white men have the lowest (~7 percent). In recent decades, AIs have seen a disproportionate increase in diabetes-related complications and mortality compared to all other groups, such that age-adjusted diabetes death rates in AI men are now almost twice those in white men. Several large randomized, controlled trials in non-AIs confirm that type 2 diabetes can be prevented or delayed by interventions that promote healthy lifestyles, but little empirical data exist on interventions to prevent diabetes in AI men. In the clinic-based U.S. Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP), only 55 out of 3,234 participants were AI men. Similarly, in the diabetes prevention programs in Native communities, participation by AI males is low, ranging from 33 percent to 74 percent. Many explanations have been posited for the low participation rates among men of all races in lifestyle interventions. Recruiting AI men in clinic-based programs is difficult because they tend to seek clinical care less often than women. AI men's perceptions of normative health behaviors and gender roles may also discourage participation, particularly in mixed-gender groups. Therefore, an urgent need exists for diabetes risk reduction programs tailored to the unique values and habits of AI men, with a particular focus on recruitment and retention. We are collaborating with the Mille Lacs Band of Ojibwe (Minnesota), the Indian Health Board of Minneapolis (Minnesota), and Yakama Nation and Heritage University Center for Native American Health and Culture (Washington) to develop the Strong Men, Strong Communities (SMSC) program. This is a culturally appropriate approach for AI men that targets modifiable diabetes risk factors. It uses methods adapted from successful, non-clinic based programs for other high-risk minority populations, and it incorporates elements of DPP and SDPI-DP. Our specific aims are to 1) refine the SMSC intervention with feedback from focus groups in our 3 partner communities; 2) compare change in diabetes risk score (primary outcome) and modifiable diabetes risk factors (secondary outcomes) in the SMSC intervention and wait-list control groups; and 3) evaluate the ability of SMSC to retain 80 percent of 240 AI male participants, 21-65 years of age with no previous diagnosis of diabetes. The proposed study fills a striking gap in approaches to increase recruitment and participation in lifestyle programs that reduce diabetes risk in AI men. The proposed study will have broad implications for the ongoing epidemic of AI obesity and diabetes. Given the need to increase AI men's participation in lifestyle interventions, our findings might have substantial public health impact on tribal communities across the U.S.",1,1,,,,,,,lifestyle change program for american indian adults,1
20153002,Improving veteran engagement in diabetes prevention,"Despite the availability of evidence-based strategies to prevent type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), engagement in these strategies is low among at-risk veterans. A key opportunity to engage at-risk veterans in interventions to prevent T2DM is when they are informed they have prediabetes. It remains unclear how VHA communications to patients diagnosed with prediabetes could be optimized to improve their engagement in evidence-based preventive strategies. Objectives: Aim 1 is to describe at-risk veterans' current engagement in behaviors to prevent T2DM and the mediators of this engagement. Aim 2 is to examine the effects of receipt of a prediabetes diagnosis on at-risk veterans' weight and engagement in behaviors to prevent T2DM. Aim 3 is to identify the effects of 5 strategies from behavioral economics and health psychology on weight, HbA1c, and engagement in behaviors to prevent T2DM among veterans with prediabetes. Methods: To accomplish aim 1, we surveyed 369 non-diabetic veterans with risk factors for T2DM about their engagement in behaviors to prevent T2DM and mediators of this engagement, such as risk perception, motivation, and awareness of and preferences for preventive strategies. To accomplish aim 2, we are conducting a pilot randomized trial among 315 non-diabetic veterans from project 1 in which 252 of these veterans were randomly assigned to undergo screening for T2DM using a hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) test. The 107 veterans who were found to have HbA1c values in the prediabetes range received that diagnosis and preventive recommendations via brief standardized counseling. All 315 veterans are having their weight tracked over the next year and are being surveyed immediately after the screening and brief counseling process, at 3 months, and at 1 year. In our analyses we will compare changes in weight, engagement in behaviors to prevent T2DM, and mediators of this engagement between the 107 veterans found to have prediabetes and the 63 veterans who were not screened. Among the 107 veterans with prediabetes, we conducted 20 semi-structured interviews to gain insights into the effects of this diagnosis and brief counseling. To accomplish aim 3, we are conducting a factorial design experiment to evaluate the effectiveness of 5 innovative strategies from behavioral economics and health psychology in promoting initial engagement in behaviors to prevent T2DM among 144 veterans who at baseline had a recent HbA1c test result in the prediabetes range but were not engaged in an evidence-based strategy to prevent T2DM. Impact: Prevention of T2DM is an important way to improve veterans' health and limit the burden of T2DM on the VHA. In this CDA, we will identify new opportunities for improving veteran engagement in evidence-based ways to prevent T2DM. Insights generated from this research will be exportable to other high-priority conditions in which veteran engagement in preventive behaviors is essential and could be improved.",1,1,,,,,,,interview veterans about potential engagement strategies for diabetes prevention,1
20153071,Medication changes in hospitalized older adults,"Background: When older adults are hospitalized, they are often discharged on substantially different medication regimens than the ones they were using prior to admission. In this setting, errors of medication reconciliation and problems with medication adherence are common. To address these problems, much effort has focused on improving medication reconciliation and communication at the time of discharge. However, little attention has been paid to the medication changes themselves that happen during the hospital stay. These changes are often inappropriate, and can lead to medication confusion, non-adherence, and adverse drug reactions in the weeks and months after hospital discharge. This is particularly important for chronic diseases such as hypertension and diabetes, as medicines for these conditions may often be changed during the hospital stay and perpetuated at discharge despite having little relation to the reason for admission. Aims: The aims are (1) to determine the frequency and epidemiology of changes to medication regimens for hypertension and diabetes in older adults admitted to VA hospitals, (2) to evaluate the impact of these medication changes on medication persistence and adherence in the year after discharge, and (3) to evaluate the association between changes to chronic medications during the hospital stay and subsequent emergency department visits and hospital readmissions. Methods: Using national data from VA and Medicare, we will assemble a retrospective cohort of veterans age 65 years and older who had hypertension or diabetes and were hospitalized in a VA medical center with community-acquired pneumonia, urinary tract infection, or venous thromboembolism. (These conditions were chosen because they are common and are treated with a different set of medications than those used to manage hypertension and diabetes). Using claims data and targeted chart review, we will identify 500 patients who were discharged on more aggressive regimens for blood pressure and/or glycemic control than they were receiving prior to admission, and a control group of 500 patients without intensified regimens. We will use standard methods to evaluate persistence of and adherence to medications in the year after hospital discharge. We will use Cox regression and mixed effects generalized linear models to compare medication persistence and adherence in patients who were discharged from the hospital with a more intensive medication regimen vs. patients whose medication regimens were not intensified. We will use similar methods to determine the impact of medication changes during hospitalization on subsequent emergency department use and hospital readmission.",1,1,,,,,,,medication changes on adherence,1
20153160,Emotional distress in a comparative effectiveness trial of diabetes treatments,"Emotional distress, including depression and diabetes-specific distress (e.g., feeling overwhelmed by living with diabetes, feelings of failure related to diabetes self-care), is a significant and prevalent problem for patients with type 2 diabetes. Both depression and diabetes distress have been associated with metabolic/glycemic control, diabetes complications, mortality, and quality of life. Recent findings further suggest that risk for emotional distress is influenced by diabetes treatment. The GRADE study (Glycemia Reduction Approaches in Diabetes: A Comparative Effectiveness Study) is generating prospective data that will provide a unique opportunity to examine the relationships between emotional distress, diabetes treatment, and outcomes in an experimental design. The GRADE study is a randomized clinical trial that will compare the metabolic effects of four common anti-diabetic drugs when combined with metformin. This sub-study will recruit a total of 2,500 patients who are within ten years of diagnosis and are being treated with metformin monotherapy at the time of enrollment. The study will examine patient-level variation in baseline emotional distress as a predictor of glycemic control and other health outcomes, independent of treatment effects. The study will also provide a rigorous experimental examination of treatment regimen effects on emotional distress over time as part of the overall evaluation of comparative effectiveness. Evaluation of emotional distress using well-validated measures will allow us to disentangle the roles of depressive symptoms and diabetes distress, factors that share significant overlap but require distinct approaches to screening and treatment. Study findings will directly inform practice decisions regarding screening and treatment for emotional distress as part of diabetes care.",1,1,,,,,,,patient-leel variation in emotional distress on glycemic control,1
20153198,The safety and effectiveness of diabetes quality metrics in elderly patients,"Improving health care quality for seniors with diabetes is a critical issue for clinicians, health care systems, and policy makers. The Medicare STAR program is the primary way in which the Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) monitors quality of care for seniors with diabetes in health plans caring for Medicare enrollees. CMS attaches significant monetary incentives to these Medicare STAR measures for health plans, distributing millions of dollars to plans annually based on STAR results. A recent change in CMS policy introduced three new diabetes-relevant metrics to the Medicare STAR portfolio in 2012: adherence to oral antihyperglycemic, antihyperlipidemic, and antihypertensive medications. Current guidelines apply these metrics to all Medicare beneficiaries older than 18, with no upper age limit and no adjustment for the number or type of comorbidities patients experience. Quality metrics for patients with chronic illness are generally based on clinical trial evidence of reduced risk for clinical outcomes like cardiovascular events or stroke, and are conducted in younger study populations with few or no comorbidities. These data may not be generalizable or even appropriate for elderly patients, who often have multiple concurrent conditions and who may place a higher value on maintaining quality of life. Whether the CMS-defined adherence measures are sufficiently linked to CVD risk factor control outcomes for elderly diabetes patients, especially those with multiple comorbidities, is unknown. In addition, when applied to complex and elderly patients, quality metrics designed to increase medication adherence may increase adverse outcomes such as hypoglycemia and hypotension that reduce quality of life. The objective of this application is to leverage a secondary data source of over 120,000 diabetes patients over the age of 65 to assess how adherence to diabetes oral medications, statins, and blood pressure medications impact safety and outcomes for Medicare patients with diabetes, and to examine how these effects are influenced by the presence of key comorbidities. The specific aims of this research are to examine the impact of advanced age and specific comorbidities on meeting defined levels of adherence to CVD risk factor medications in diabetes patients; to compare the effectiveness of meeting adherence targets on CVD risk factor control, adverse events, and health care utilization; and to disseminate the study's findings to a wide range of clinical, operational, and policy stakeholders.

Even with such high prevalence of co-occurrence, there is limited information about whether and why outcomes may be worse in women with both breast cancer and diabetes versus only breast cancer; there is even less information for how best to treat these patients considering the interaction of the diseases and their treatments. For example, tamoxifen and carboplatin, adjuvant chemotherapy agents for breast cancer, may worsen diabetic neuropathy. Delayed wound healing in patients with diabetes may impact chemotherapy optimal timing. Corticosteroids to control vomiting during chemotherapy may elevate blood sugar and complicate diabetes management. Women with diabetes use mammography screening less. Metformin for diabetes may improve therapeutic response in breast cancer. Clearly, care decisions are more complex when patients have more than one serious health condition, and their interaction begs for a systematic evaluation. Accordingly, our aims and associated hypotheses are 1) to determine how diabetes impacts the breast cancer quality of care; 2) to determine the impact of diabetes-related variations in breast cancer care on recurrence and breast-cancer-specific and overall mortality; and 3) to determine how breast cancer affects diabetes quality of care in breast cancer patients with diabetes. We will collect comprehensive and granular data on a large sample of patients affected by both diseases, and therefore maximize the potential for evaluating the above aims and hypotheses. In order to improve care for multimorbid patients and to better understand how and why patients with breast cancer and diabetes have worse outcomes than those without diabetes, we will analyze two complementary cohorts of subjects with breast cancer: the linked SEER-Medicare data, including hospital, outpatient, physician, and medication claims for women ages 66-85 years; and richly detailed clinical data from an integrated delivery system, Group Health in Western Washington State for women ages 50-85 years. Employing innovative statistical methods on two datasets, one with broad generalizability and one with highly detailed clinical information, we will evaluate what factors most impact health outcomes in breast cancer patients with and without pre-existing diabetes and whether diabetes mediates racial/ethnic inequities in breast cancer treatment and outcomes. The analyses will use innovative statistical methods to tease apart the complexities of simultaneous disease management. This innovative study will help inform optimal care coordination and evidence-based interventions in order to reduce avoidable morbidity and mortality from breast cancer and diabetes. This work also builds a platform for evaluating the interaction between cancer and other burdensome co-existing comorbidities.",1,1,,,,,,,"diabetes and breast cancer links, plus metformin use",1
20153553,The impact of state-varying components of the Affordable Care Act on prescription fills for diabetes and hypertension,"Policymakers and the American public need to know whether the Affordable Care Act (ACA) is increasing access to effective health care, and which specific resources are working. The ACA was implemented through a cluster of federal grants to the states that varied in topic and size, making it difficult to assess the impact of individual funding components across states. For example, targeted funds to establish state-based exchanges support Medicaid expansions, and assist consumers post-enrollment were accepted in some states, but not in others. Decoupling the effects of these components is critical for policymaking. To make decisions about how to prioritize spending in the future, policymakers need to know what has worked in the past. One important effect of the ACA could be increasing use of effective medications for diabetes and hypertension, two chronic conditions which affect millions of Americans and can be controlled through medications. As such, the overall aim of this project is to measure the impact of four state-varying components of the ACA--Medicaid expansions, state-based marketplace implementation, and funding for pre-enrollment and post-enrollment assistance programs--on prescription fills for diabetes and hypertension, using geographic variation to identify causal effects. By using two methods, I can reach more precise conclusions about how the components build on one another. Specifically, I will (specific aim 1) use a parametric (regression) approach to estimate the causal impact of state-varying components of the ACA on prescription fills for diabetes and hypertension. Because the state-varying components of the ACA were not randomly assigned to states, I will correct for time-varying political, economic, and health-related determinants of state-level decisions as well as time-invariant factors, and implement additional corrections if tests suggest it is necessary. To distinguish changes in prescription use due to improved access to care from changes in disease prevalence, I will correct for the need for prescriptions using estimates of self-reported diabetes from CDC and estimates of total hypertension from my previous research; and (specific aim 2) use a semi-parametric (matching) approach to conduct an extensive robustness check of the estimates. Some counties at state borders are similar in many ways but subjected to vastly different ACA implementations. Using these counties, I can calculate the same causal effects as in specific aim 1 but using a matched-pairs difference-in-differences approach. Although this method is less standard in the health literature, it uses fewer assumptions about how the state-varying components of the ACA build on one another. Policymakers need to know which resources related to the ACA had impact on access to effective health care. The goal of this project is to provide precisely this information. By employing two methods, I will be able to reach robust conclusions about the incremental impact of four state-varying components of the ACA.",1,,,,,1,,,ACA evaluation,1
20154086,Ensuring quality and care coordination in the era of Veterans Choice,"Background: VHA has the most extensive tracking and reporting system of any health care system in the country. However, veterans are increasingly receiving care by non-VHA providers, creating challenges for this tracking and monitoring system. VHA must develop methods to identify, prioritize, and track care in both VHA and non-VHA settings in order to ensure veterans continue to receive appropriate care. Providing appropriate health care means ensuring that patients get the care they need while avoiding care that is unnecessary or harmful. Previously, there was focus on increasing the use of necessary services. Today, there is growing national interest in identifying and reducing overuse--care that exposes patients to services that are not beneficial or may cause harm and which may take scarce resources away from those who would benefit from them. The appropriateness of this care extends not just to clinical processes but also to care experiences (e.g., access, continuity, coordination). Objectives: The objectives are to (1) identify and prioritize measures of underuse and overuse relevant to the Veterans Choice Act (VCA) (aim 1); (2) assess the use of existing and non-VHA data sources to evaluate quality of care for VCA users (aim 2a/2b); and (3) identify areas of importance to veterans with respect to access, continuity, and coordination (aim 3). Methods: Aim 1: In this aim, we assembled an expert council comprised of national VHA clinical and policy leaders to identify clinical areas most important to current and future VCA participants. Council members identified fifteen clinical areas and then prioritized these based on improvement opportunity and feasibility of measurement. Project staff conducted a rapid, high-level environmental scan to identify measures, guidelines, and recommendations related to the top eight clinical areas. Using a modified Delphi panel process, council members rated the measures, guidelines, and recommendations on validity/importance, feasibility of measurement, and improvement opportunity. Aim 2a: To better understand the accuracy of medications in VA automated data (i.e., in CDW, including VHA and non-VHA medication fields), we conducted a brief phone survey with 100 VHA patients with diabetes who had an outpatient visit between 10/1/14 and 3/31/15 either within VHA or outside VHA as part of VCA. Additionally, non-VHA scanned records from 260 patients with diabetes who had a VCA or fee-basis outpatient encounter for diabetes care between 10/1/14 and 6/30/15 were reviewed to assess the feasibility of using those scanned records to evaluate the quality of care that veterans are receiving in the community. Medications on these scanned records were compared with medications in CDW. Aim 2b: In this aim, we developed a script and tested an interactive voice response (IVR) approach for collecting treatment outcomes to allow outcome-based quality measurement of veterans' depression care. One hundred patients, from VISN 11, with newly diagnosed depression were mailed an invitation to participate. Baseline calls, via IVR, were made to those who did not opt out. Aim 3: To identify measures of patient satisfaction with care coordination and access, we completed a review of existing survey items. Domains found to be most relevant to the VCA were used to inform questions for an interview guide. Ten semi-structured patient interviews were conducted to determine if domains emerged that were not well covered by existing survey items. The final list of domains was used to inform the content of a day-long deliberative consensus-oriented session. Twenty-three veterans participated in the session to identify factors that likely influence their desire to use non-VHA care and factors that lead to greater satisfaction with access, continuity, and care coordination. Findings: Aim 1: The eight clinical areas prioritized by the expert council included diagnosis, treatment, and/or screening/surveillance for back pain, cardiac testing, diabetes, GI procedures, headaches, hepatitis C, prostate cancer, and PTSD. Within these areas, 29 measures/guidelines/recommendations (8 VHA measures/guidelines; 7 NQF-endorsed measures; 11 Choosing Wisely recommendations; 3 other) were rated as highly valid/important for patients receiving care in the community. Aim 2a: Twenty-two percent of phone survey respondents reported taking medications prescribed by a non-VHA provider that were not in the CDW (VHA or non-VHA medication fields). Comparing the medications found on the non-VHA scanned records with medications in CDW revealed that 15% of patients had at least one diabetes medication on a scanned record that wasn't in CDW. The percentage was the same for statins (15%) and higher for blood pressure medications (25%). Aim 2b: Thirty-five patients provided baseline depression data via IVR. Respondents reported a mean PHQ-9 (Patient Health Questionnaire depression scale) score of 11.9; scores ranged from 0 (no depressive symptoms) to 27 (severely depressed). Aim 3: During the interviews, two new care coordination domains emerged: 1) burden that falls on the patient and family to ensure care coordination and 2) effort required and resulting stress to determine financial responsibility. During the deliberative sessions, veterans recommended that ""condition severity"" be a criterion for deciding whether veterans should get care in the community; this included consideration of clinical necessity for getting care in the community and burden taken on by the veteran to get care at VHA. After deliberation, veterans favored funds to strengthen VHA (building) rather than increasing payment for care in the community (buying). Impact: The approach developed in aim 1 to identify and prioritize quality measures for VCA could be used by VHA for identifying and prioritizing other quality measures. Additionally, for those areas where an improvement opportunity is confirmed, the measures/recommendations could soon be implemented as quality tracking measures for veterans receiving care in the community. Our findings from aim 2 suggest that in order to accurately evaluate quality of care for veterans receiving care in the community, non-VHA prescribed medications need to be better documented in CDW. Additionally, this aim demonstrated that it is feasible to use IVR to collect outcomes from patients receiving care in the community; with slight modifications to increase the response rate (e.g., an initial live person contact), the IVR technology could be adapted for operational use across VHA for essentially any patient-reported outcome. The information gathered in aim 3 could be used by VHA to guide development of new survey measures related to care coordination and access.",1,,,,,,1,,developing quality measues with qualitative work,1
20154267,Preventing amputations by tailored risk-based intervention to optimize therapy,"Background: Veterans with diabetes are at high risk for foot ulcers and amputations, particularly if they have neuropathy, vascular disease, or anatomic abnormalities, and have poor foot self-care, poor foot self-monitoring, and/or nonadherence to diet, medication, and exercise. It is difficult to activate at-risk veterans to improve self-care and self-monitoring, and lower other amputation risks such as A1c and other risk factors. Objectives: Proposed is a randomized controlled trial testing the effectiveness of a comprehensive personalized behavioral intervention (PBI) aimed to improve foot self-care, foot self-monitoring, and modifiable risks for amputation such as peripheral vascular disease (PVD), A1c, BP and LDL, using behavioral counseling combined with dermal thermometry. The primary specific aim is to evaluate the effect of PBI on the proportion of ulcerative and non-ulcerative lesions compared to current best practice (CBP) in diabetes. The secondary specific aims are to evaluate the impact of PBI on foot self-care skills, foot education, and adherence, A1c, BP, and LDL, and quality of life at 6 months; its longer term effects at 12 months on foot care, adherence, and risk factors; and cost-effectiveness compared to CBP. Methods: We will recruit 404 veterans with diabetes who are at higher than normal risk of foot ulcers (PAVE score of 1, 2 or 3, with no history of ulcers or amputations). The interventions will be standardized, and fidelity of the intervention will be maintained. Using a blinded RCT, we will test the effect of PBI in relation to CBP. Key outcomes are non-ulcerative and ulcerative lesions, foot-care skills, foot care education, adherence to diet and medication, and general and foot health-specific quality of life, A1c, BP, and LDL. Outcomes will be measured at baseline, 6, and 12 months. All analyses will be intent-to-treat. Findings: No data has been collected yet so there are no findings to report. Impact: This study will evaluate a comprehensive risk-stratified PBI targeting multiple behaviors related to self-care, self-monitoring, and amputation risk. This study applies advanced behavioral theories to intervene to improve care for veterans at risk for amputation. If this promising theory-driven approach can work in a clinical setting where improvements in foot care are urgently needed, it will be an important scientific contribution that could lower the risk of amputation in veterans with diabetes.",1,1,,,,,,,personalized behavioral intervention,1
20162349,Bridging Income Generation with Group Integrated Care (BIGPIC),"Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of mortality in the world. Diabetes, a major risk factor for CVD, is increasingly prevalent and responsible for substantial cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Elevated blood pressure (BP) increases CVD risk among individuals with diabetes and pre-diabetes; BP control is therefore a powerful way to reduce CVD risk. Cost-effective, context-specific, and culturally appropriate interventions are critical, and both group medical visits and microfinance have the potential to achieve this. In partnership with the Government of Kenya, the Academic Model Providing Access to Healthcare Partnership has expanded its clinical scope of work in rural western Kenya to include diabetes and hypertension, and has piloted group care and microfinance initiatives with promising early results. However, the effectiveness of these strategies individually, and in combination, on improving CVD risk is not known. Thus, the overall objective of this proposal is to utilize a transdisciplinary implementation research approach to address the challenge of reducing CVD risk in low-resource settings. Specifically, we propose to test the hypothesis that group medical visits integrated into microfinance groups will be effective and cost-effective in reducing CVD risk among individuals with diabetes and at increased risk for diabetes in western Kenya. We further hypothesize that changes in social network characteristics may mediate the impact of these interventions, and that baseline social network characteristics may moderate the impact. Aim 1 is to identify contextual factors, facilitators, and barriers that may impact integration of group medical visits and microfinance groups in this setting, using novel qualitative research techniques. We will then design a contextually and culturally appropriate integrated group medical visit-microfinance model for CVD risk reduction. Aim 2 is to evaluate the effectiveness of group medical visits and microfinance groups for CVD risk reduction among individuals with diabetes or at increased risk of diabetes, by conducting a four-arm cluster randomized trial comparing 1) usual clinical care, 2) usual clinical care plus microfinance groups only, 3) group medical visits only, and 4) group medical visits integrated into microfinance groups. The primary outcome will be one-year change in systolic BP, and a key secondary outcome will be change in QRISK2 CVD risk score. We will also conduct mediation analysis and moderation analysis to evaluate the influence of social network characteristics on intervention outcomes. Aim 3 is to evaluate the incremental cost-effectiveness of each intervention arm of the trial. The research will be accomplished by an early stage principal investigator with extensive experience in implementation research in low-resource settings, supported by a transdisciplinary team of investigators with diverse and complementary expertise. Our goal is to add to the existing knowledge base of innovative, scalable, and sustainable strategies to reduce CVD risk in diabetes and other chronic diseases in low-resource settings worldwide.",1,,1,,,,,,group care and microfinance groups for diabetes prevention,1
20173412,STEP UP to avert amputation in diabetes,"Anticipated impacts on veterans' healthcare: While amputation rates for veterans with diabetes have been reduced with system and provider intervention, they continue to be high. Amputation is a devastating complication that is preceded in > 80% of cases by a diabetic foot ulcer. This study applies advanced behavioral theories to intervene to improve care for veterans at risk for amputation combined with dermal thermometry. If this promising theory-driven approach can work in a clinical setting where improvements in foot care are urgently needed for these vulnerable veterans with a previous ulcer, it will be an important scientific contribution that could lower the risk of recurrent ulcers and amputation in veterans with diabetes. Project background: Veterans with diabetes who have had a previous ulcer are at highest risk for new ulcers and amputation, particularly if they have neuropathy or vascular disease and have poor foot self-care or non-adherence to diet, medication, and exercise recommendations. It is difficult to activate at-risk patients to improve self-care and detect foot abnormalities or inflammation at an early stage, particularly when they have other risks to manage. Interventions targeting mediators of amputation risk (ulcer recurrence) promise to lower risk and improve outcomes in these high-risk veterans. Dermal thermometry effectively allows for early identification of inflammation and is a warning sign to contact a healthcare professional. Interventions are more effective when they are behaviorally tailored and combine multiple behavioral theories. This study will evaluate a comprehensive risk-stratified personalized tailored intervention aimed to improve self-care and reduce ulcer recurrence in veterans with diabetes and prior diabetic foot ulcer. Project objectives: Proposed is a randomized controlled trial (RCT) testing the effectiveness of a comprehensive tailored intervention (TI) aimed to improve self-care and self-monitoring (including dermal thermometry) through behavioral counseling. The primary specific aim is to evaluate if TI reduces the proportion of recurrent ulcers at 18 months compared to the current practice (CP) group. The secondary specific aims are to evaluate the impact of TI on foot care skills, quality of life (QOL), peak plantar pressure, and step count, compared to CP at 18 months. Exploratory aims will be to examine the impact of TI on amputation, gait temporal-spatial parameters, C-reactive protein, glycosylated hemoglobin (A1c), and depression at 18 months, compared to CP. Project methods: We will recruit adults with diabetes who have had a previously healed foot ulcer. Using a blinded RCT, we will test the effect of TI in relation to CP. Participants in TI will receive a comprehensive intervention, including telephone counseling and tailored mailings from health counselors. The TI is an integrated, personalized intervention targeting foot self-care and self-monitoring that includes dermal thermometry as well as diet, exercise, and medication-taking, incorporating the transtheoretical model and prospect theory and delivered using motivational interviewing principles. The intervention will be standardized and fidelity of the intervention will be maintained. Participants randomized to CP will receive enhancements--current VA best practices for improving foot risk, as well as telephone counseling and mailings from health counselors providing education about health prevention strategies not related to diabetes or foot care. Key outcomes are ulceration, QOL, plantar pressure, physical activity, and foot care skills. Outcomes will be measured at baseline, and 6, 12 and 18 months. All analyses will be intent-to-treat.",1,1,,,,,,,tailored intervention to reduce amputation risk in veterans,1
20153267,Development and validation of a risk calculator for total joint replacement,"Background: Advanced osteoarthritis of the hip and knee is treated with total joint arthroplasty (TJA). Among the most common orthopedic procedures performed in VHA, roughly 11,000 total hip and knee arthroplasty surgeries were conducted in fiscal year 2011. Although complications during and following total joint arthroplasty are overall relatively rare (about 5% nationally), dramatic variation exists in the likelihood of complications based on patient demographic and clinical factors (e.g., diabetes, alcohol misuse, smoking, body mass index). Currently, VHA orthopedic surgeons have no systematic and validated way of using a TJA candidate's demographic and clinical profile to estimate his or her risk of complications or death related to the procedure, satisfaction with results, or likelihood of improvement. Objectives: This study aims to develop and validate a tool to improve informed consent and help prevent complications from TJA: a risk, benefit, and satisfaction calculator that will allow for easy, accurate estimation of the personalized risks and benefits for each candidate. Methods: To develop the TJA risk calculator, we will use the most recent three years of VHA Corporate Date Warehouse (CDW) and VA Surgical Quality Improvement Project (VASQIP) data to merge data on outcomes, especially death and major complications, and many known and candidate predictors of outcomes. For the TJA benefit calculator, 1200 patients scheduled to undergo TJA at three VA medical centers (Palo Alto, San Francisco, Minneapolis) will be recruited to provide pre-operative symptom, functioning, expectation, and quality of life data and then reassessed one year later. The results from these pre- and post-operative questionnaires will be linked with VASQIP and CDW data in order to develop predictive benefit models, especially changes in functioning and pain, based on pre-operative, demographic, and clinical data. We will create the patient satisfaction calculator using data from the 1200 recruited patients. We will then develop and pilot test a CDW-integrated risk/benefit calculator and decision support system. This decision support tool can be used by surgeons and patients within a shared decision making process to weigh the patient-tailored risks and probable benefits of a TJA. The calculator will also help identify factors such as smoking or diabetic control that might be addressed prior to surgery in order to minimize risks and maximize potential benefits of the procedure. Findings: We completed aim 1, the results of which have been accepted for publication in the Journal of Arthroplasty. http://www.arthroplastyjournal.org/article/S0883-5403(17)31091-4/fulltext. Results: A total of 70,569 patients diagnosed with OA who received primary TJA were included. C-statistics and bootstrapped confidence intervals for the cross validation of the boosted regression models were highest for cardiac complications (0.75: 0.71 to 0.79) and 30-day mortality (0.73: 0.66 to 0.79), and lowest for deep vein thrombosis (0.59: 0.55 to 0.64 and return to the operating room (0.60: 0.57 to 0.63). Conclusions: Moderately accurate predictive models of 30-day mortality and cardiac complications following TJA in VHA patients were developed and internally cross-validated. By reporting model coefficients and performance metrics, other model developers can test these models on new samples, and have a procedure and indication-specific benchmark to surpass. Data collection for aim 2 is almost complete. Impact: This project will develop and validate a unique risk and benefit calculator for veterans anticipating a total joint replacement. It will improve shared decision making and increase the value of informed consent for veterans undergoing TJA. It will also help identify factors such as smoking or diabetic control that might be addressed prior to surgery in order to minimize risks and maximize potential benefits for veterans undergoing TJA. This project is also poised to further thinking on methods and standards for surgical prediction models. For example, using VA data, we conducted a cross-validation of the American Joint Replacement Risk Calculator and found it to have poor accuracy.",1,,,1,,,,,using individual characteristics to predict complications for arthritis surgery,1
20153342,Estimation of multi-treatment effects from observational data with application to diabetes mellitus,"Background: Patient-centered outcomes research is meant to enable patients to make informed health care decisions, based on the patients' conditions, characteristics, and preferences. To make conscious decisions, patients should be informed of the potential outcomes for all possible treatment options. Using these outcomes and based on the patients' preferences, the optimal treatment can be identified. Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) are the gold standard for identifying optimal treatment options. However, RCTs usually compare two treatments on a small homogenous group of patients. Thus, observational data are the main tool to identify the optimal treatment among several when applied to a large cohort. Objectives: This proposal is aimed at testing and providing guidance for utilization of statistical methods aimed at estimation of optimal treatment among a group of three or more treatments. This method will provide researchers with guidelines for choosing the most appropriate statistical method when comparing more than three treatments. We will also develop new methods for estimation, when currently used methods are inadequate. Future directions of this project will address extension of this analysis to compare multiple treatments when the effects are heterogeneous. Methods: We will use extensive simulation analyses that are based on plausible realistic settings to examine current as well as newly proposed procedures for estimating treatment effect with multiple treatments. These simulations will allow us to identify the optimal method that should be used by investigators based on their own questions and datasets. Anticipated impact: We will provide guidelines for statistical procedures aimed at estimating treatment effects from observational data that include multiple treatments. We will also provide software implementing the possible methods for use by other researchers. In addition, we will apply the proposed methods to an important medical question that will examine the effects of non-insulin antihyperglycemic treatment regimens (mono-/poly-therapy) on the occurrence of acute myocardial infarction in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. If the estimates produced by the different methods are different, we will rely on the conclusions from the simulation analysis to justify the method that should be used.",1,,,,,,1,,methods development,1
20152312,Causal analyses of electronic health record data for assessing the comparative effectiveness of treatment regimens,"Background: Effective management of chronic conditions such as type 2 diabetes (T2D) requires periodic clinical monitoring and frequent re-evaluation of treatment decisions over the course of the patients' illness. To optimize and personalize care, the relevant treatment strategies to compare should not only adapt to the patient's evolving clinical condition, but should also integrate the levels of both adherence to treatment and the frequency of clinical monitoring. The comparison of such complex adaptive treatment strategies is particularly relevant to patients and stakeholders concerned over the burden imposed by both daily medication intake and the frequency of clinical monitoring. Because randomized trials are not well suited to produce such heterogeneous evidence, advanced analytic methods that can be applied to real-world observational data and emulate trial inferences are needed. Existing causal inference methods are not well adapted to real-world data that are highly variable in timing and content such as electronic health record (EHR) data. Objectives: We propose to advance and adapt existing causal inference methods so they can not only be adequately applied to real-world observational data, but also to better inform the impact of both real-world treatment adherence and frequency of clinical monitoring in comparative effectiveness research (CER). Methods: Using both simulated data and existing EHR data from a recent non-randomized T2D study, we will evaluate the applicability and practical performance of these new tools in real-world CER. In particular, we will study their behaviors in studies with relatively small sample sizes and document the conditions under which these methods can provide valid CER evidence. Stakeholders will drive the development, illustration, and dissemination of the proposed methods by identifying areas within chronic disease management with high-priority CER questions. Patient and stakeholder engagement. Meetings with stakeholders will not focus on the technical aspects of the proposed analytic methods. Instead, insights from patients, practicing clinicians, clinical and operational health plan leaders, and CER researchers will help us understand the types of comparative effectiveness questions involving sequences of treatment and monitoring decisions that are of most value to health care decision-makers, with a focus on the management of chronic diseases and type 2 diabetes in particular. Anticipated impact. This project will improve the applicability of sophisticated causal methods with EHR data to compare complex treatment strategies that that can better inform decision making by clinicians and patients for the management of chronic conditions. It will increase the transparency, relevance, validity, and precision of the evidence generated with these advanced causal inference methods.",1,,,,,,1,,methods development- causal inference,1
20152055,Active and Healthy Brotherhood: a program for chronic disease self-management for black men,"African American men are more likely to have high blood pressure, diabetes, and heart disease compared to other groups in the U.S., which increases the risk for early death, stroke, heart disease, and other sickness, and poor life quality. African American males are also less likely to go to the doctor to get medical care and are less likely to have lifestyles that can improve their health. Our team met with African American males to understand how to help them improve their health. Patients said not knowing how to manage stress or the basic facts about chronic disease made it difficult to control. Patients also said they had trouble eating healthy and exercising regularly, particularly when trying to stick within a budget. This study will test ways to improve health behaviors using an intervention that has been specially designed for African American men. The program, called Active & Healthy Brotherhood (AHB), will teach men basic health information, plus put them in groups to learn about healthy eating, physical activity, stress management, and how to get medical care when it is needed. There will be about 16 AHB sessions and men will participate for about 4 months. Patients in the AHB group sessions will receive 3 phone calls, about every other week, when the groups are over to check on their progress. We will compare the AHB intervention with a control group that will teach patients basic health information using videos and brochures. All information for patients will be provided by health educators. After intervening for 6 months patients will practice behaviors on their own for another 6 months. Patients will be 400 black men, age 30-64 years, who have high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart disease. We will also recruit men who say they are not eating a healthy diet or exercising because those men are at high risk for getting disease. We will recruit patients from around the community. Patients will be randomly chosen to participate in either the intervention or the control group for 6 months. We will collect data from patients at the beginning of the study, after 6 months when the intervention is over, and again at 12 months. We will measure how well each strategy works to improve health behaviors and lower risk factors, like blood pressure, blood sugar, and weight. We will also measure factors about patients, like age and income, to see if those factors impact how the strategies work. This project is led by researchers, health service providers, and patients, who all helped with the grant proposal. Everyone on the research team will help finalize the strategies, recruit patients, and interpret the study data. If any of the strategies work, the team will help identify ways to spread the interventions to other places where people might get medical advice (for example, churches). Data from this project will be used to understand the best ways to help people manage their own health.",1,1,1,,,,,,individualized plus group intervention for riskf actors for diabetes etc.,1
20162290,Optimizing the value of primary care delivered by nurse practitioners,"Background: Nurse practitioners (NPs) account for 20% of the VA primary care provider workforce and provide more than 2 million primary care visits a year. Research supports that primary care NPs provide safe, effective care comparable to that provided by physicians (MDs) in general populations. However, VA patients are more clinically complex requiring more intensive clinical management compared with the general population. Research on NP performance in VA primary care is limited. Objectives: The study aimed to conduct a comprehensive assessment of NP performance by comparing patients cared for by NPs with those cared for by physicians (MDs). Aim 1 examined differences in utilization and costs; aim 2 compared patient satisfaction and clinical outcomes; and aim 3 assessed the perceptions and experiences of care under NPs using semi-structured interviews with patients and primary care providers. Methods: Aims 1 and 2: We used a retrospective cohort design using VA administrative databases and the VA Survey of Healthcare Experiences of Patients (SHEP). The study sample included 806,434 VA primary care patients of MDs who were reassigned to either an MD (n=696,404) or an NP (n=110,030) when their provider left the system in calendar years 2010-2013. We compared patient outcomes between provider types one year after the reassignment. Aim 1 examined utilization and cost by analyzing clinic visits, hospitalizations, and total outpatient and inpatient costs. Aim 2 examined patient outcomes for three disease cohorts, including glycemic control for diabetes (n=207,297), lipid control (LDL) for ischemic heart disease (IHD, n=113,278), and blood pressure (BP) control for hypertension (n=357,987). We assessed patient satisfaction among those who responded to a SHEP survey after reassignment (n=20,996). To estimate the differences between NP and MD care, we used generalized linear models, controlling for baseline patient socio-demographics, comorbidity, geographic region, VAMC provider FTEs by specialty and clustering patient-level observations by primary care clinic. Aim 3: We conducted semi-structured telephone interviews with VA patients who were recently reassigned to a different primary care provider and with VA primary care providers. We interviewed 31 PCPs (14 NPs and 17 MDs) and 28 patients (10 cared for by NPs and 18 cared for by MDs) recruited from VA facilities in both full and restricted scope of practice states. Themes related to perceptions of NPs were investigated using inductive and deductive content analysis of transcripts. Findings: Aim 1: Patients who lived farther away from VA, lived in rural areas, or received care in CBOCs were more likely to be reassigned to NPs. However, socio-demographic characteristics and comorbidity were similar between patients who were reassigned to NPs or MDs. One year after reassignment, NP patients were less likely to have any primary care (91% vs. 93%; adjusted percentage point difference [APPD] -1.3 [CI:-1.92 to -0.68]), any specialty care (31% vs. 37%; APPD -2.2 [CI:-3.10 to -1.33]), any hospitalization (8% vs. 9%; APPD -0.8 [CI:-1.24 to -0.436]), and any hospitalization for ambulatory care sensitive conditions (1.1% vs. 1.3%; APPD -0.2 [CI:-0.33 to -0.09]). Among users, NP patients had fewer primary care visits (4.9 vs. 5.1 visits; adjusted difference -0.36 visits [CI:-0.53 to -0.18]) and specialty care visits (4.5 vs. 4.9 visits; adjusted difference -0.19 visits [CI:-0.32 to -0.07]) than MD patients. The magnitude of these differences was small. There was no significant difference between NP and MD patients in having any mental health visit (28% vs. 29%), any metabolic panel test (63% vs. 65%), and any diagnostic or stress echo (1.2% vs. 1.3%). Finally, there were no significant differences between NP and MD patients in total VA outpatient cost ($4,432 vs. $4,858; adjusted difference -$114 [CI:-$231 to $3]) and total VA cost ($6,704 vs. $7,210; adjusted difference -$271 [CI: -$584 to $40]). Aim 2: Most of the clinical outcomes evaluated were not statistically significantly different between NP and MD patients. Among diabetic patients, NP patients were slightly less likely to have a hemoglobin A1C measure (88% vs. 89%; APPD -1.0 [CI:-1.41 to -0.67]), but there were no significant differences in having a normal A1C (70% vs. 72%), having any LDL measure (85% vs. 86%), and having a normal LDL (70% vs. 62%; APPD -0.6 [CI:-1.48 to 0.26]). Among patients with IHD, there were no significant differences between NP and MD patients in having any LDL measure (88% vs. 88%) and having a normal LDL (70% vs. 72%). Among patients with hypertension, there was no significant difference between NP and MD patients in having a normal BP (72% vs. 73%). Finally, there was no significant difference in patient-reported satisfaction from SHEP between the two groups. Aim 3: Three main findings emerged from qualitative interviews: 1) NPs were perceived by both patients and PCPs as providing more patient-centered care and as being better at patient education; 2) patient satisfaction and preference were tied to NPs' patient-centeredness; and 3) the accrued practice experience of individual NPs, rather than provider type, was perceived by both NPs and MDs as an important determinant of proficiency in primary care delivery and managing patient workload. Impact: This was the first study to conduct a comprehensive assessment of primary care NPs. This study is particularly timely and policy-relevant because VA gave all NPs full practice authority in 2017. The study showed that, one year after patients were reassigned, NP patients had fewer VA primary care and specialty care visits than MD patients, but the differences were small. There were no differences in VA costs, clinical outcomes, and patient-reported satisfaction. Though NPs were perceived as comparable to MDs in most ways, patients' satisfaction and preference for the holistic, patient-centered care provided by NPs was a distinct difference. Similarities in PCPs' perceptions suggest that NPs and MDs generally work well together. The study shows that NPs may be able to provide comparable primary care to MDs regarding quality of care, health care utilization, and patient experiences. The study results provide important insights in the potential impacts of the full NP practice authority in VA.",1,,,1,1,1,,1,"NP scope of practice within VA, control for geography and clinic effects",1
20152031,Extended family model of diabetes self-management education (DSME) to reduce disparities in a US Pacific Islander community,"The Marshallese population suffers from a significant and disproportionate burden of type 2 diabetes. The rate of type 2 diabetes among the Marshallese is one of the highest of any population group in the world--at least 400% higher than the general US population. Prior attempts to implement diabetes self-management education (DSME) in Marshallese populations have failed to produce even short-term results. Based on qualitative interviews using a CBPR process, we hypothesize that an adapted extended family model of DSME, based on the collectivist, family-centered values of the Marshallese community, will result in better diabetes management outcomes compared to traditional DSME. Using a community-based participatory research (CBPR) approach and an interdisciplinary research team, we will employ the cultural adaptation process (CAP) to modify and test the DSME as implemented within an extended family model. Aim 1 is to adapt the DSME for implementation within an extended family model. Aim 2 is to conduct a comparative effectiveness evaluation using a randomized control trial design that compares the results of the extended family model of DSME with traditional DSME. Two local Marshallese organizations, two community co-investigators from the Marshallese community, three community clinics, 31 Marshallese stakeholders, and an extended group of Marshallese, Pacific Islander, and diabetes experts were involved in this grant application and will continue to be involved throughout the research process. This research is highly translational. The impact of the study will help bridge the gap between knowledge of an effective DSME intervention and actual implementation of the intervention among a Pacific Islander population with especially high rates of type 2 diabetes and significant health disparities.",1,,1,,,,,,family model of care within marshallese,1

Half of those will be far along in engaging patients in their care and half will not. We will see whether patients with diabetes or cardiovascular diseases who receive care from practices that more fully involve their patients have better clinical outcomes and satisfaction with their care than those who do not. We expect that these findings will help practices and patients to achieve better outcomes of care.,1,,,1,,,,,level of patient involvement in care choices,1
20154159,Development and evaluation of a universally designed app to support self-directed diabetes education and self-management for individuals with intellectual disabilities,"This project develops and evaluates the technical merit and feasibility of Diabetes Education and Self-Management for Intellectual Disabilities (DES-MID), a universally designed educational and prompting software application to promote diabetes knowledge retention for individuals with intellectual disabilities (ID). Education and self-management are key interventions in managing diabetes. However, due to literacy deficits and a lifelong lack of opportunities to practice self-direction, individuals with ID have not had the opportunity to utilize these key interventions. Phase I of this project integrates extensive multimedia and proven interface design techniques to develop an independently usable tool, available for iOS and Android, for students and adults with ID to become more knowledgeable regarding their diabetes and provide them with accessible, hands-on supports to become more self-directed in self-managing their health. Phase II includes further design and development of time-based and step-by-step personalized multimedia prompting and real-world prototype evaluation using key diabetes and quality-of-life indicators as outcome measures. It also includes research and development into a staff training module with both general and patient-specific information to help familiarize direct-service professionals and other advocates.",1,1,,,,,,,app for those with intellectual disabilities,1
20151054,"Black college students, health disparities and disease prevention practices","In 2010, about 25.8 million Americans had diabetes, and 27% of those cases were undiagnosed. Type 2 diabetes (T2D) accounts for about 90-95% of diabetes cases; diabetes prevention is a national health objective. T2D disproportionately affects African Americans (AAs) and Hispanics, compared with non-Hispanic whites. In Texas, 2009 data revealed that 14.4% of AAs had T2D, compared with 9.7% of Hispanics and 8% of whites. Family history, overweight, and ethnicity are T2D risk factors. Lifestyle modification, including healthy eating, physical activity, and modest weight loss, can prevent T2D. The transition from adolescence to young adulthood can be a time of increased stress, and is associated with increased health risk. Poor diet, obesity and inactivity increase during this time period, particularly among AAs. For those AA students with family history of T2D, this may contribute to the increasing prevalence of T2D diagnosed among younger populations. In 2010, 24% of new T2D cases were in adults 20-39 years of age and 55% were in adults ages 40-59 years. There are over 100 Historically Black Colleges or Universities (HBCUs) in the U.S. While HBCUs have significantly contributed to the educational progress of millions of AA students, there is a lack of empirically-driven descriptive and intervention research in health promotion focused on the HBCU populations. Efforts to identify and mitigate health risk behaviors in these students may help in addressing health disparities among AAs. Therefore, we are submitting this R21 application in response to PAR-10-137, addressing Research Area 3: chronic disease prevention. We will assess the social networks of AA students attending a HBCU, with and without T2D risk, and examine the flow of health-related behaviors, attitudes, support, and information across the social networks of students. Our goal is to identify whether there are protective mechanisms within these social networks that might help to explain the differences between those students with T2D risk who report lifestyle behaviors that increase risk for early onset T2D, versus those students with T2D risk who practice lifestyle behaviors protective of T2D. We will also investigate whether a social network communication channel at an HBCU is an effective way to promote chronic disease prevention practices and reduce future risk. This proposed study has tremendous public health significance and is the first step in a program of research to develop and test effective social network-based interventions on HBCU campuses to reduce health disparities among this group.",1,,1,,,,,,social network effects at HBCUs,1
20152039,Effectiveness of collaborative goal-setting versus IMPaCT community health worker support for improving chronic disease outcomes,"Background: Chronically ill patients from low-socioeconomic status (SES) communities try their best to feel better and gain control of conditions like diabetes or high blood pressure. However, they are at high risk for poor outcomes because they often struggle with real-life challenges: How can I afford the medications my doctor ordered? How can I cut down on salt when I get my food from a pantry? There is some evidence that community health workers (CHWs) can help these patients. Yet many CHW programs have not been proven to be effective or sustainable. Our community-academic-health system team used participatory action research with high-risk patients to design IMPaCT (Individualized Management for Patient Centered Targets). IMPaCT is a standardized, comprehensive CHW model that was proven to work in a large clinical trial of hospitalized patients. The study team used further participatory action research with chronically ill primary care patients to adapt IMPaCT for primary care. We propose this study to test the newly adapted IMPaCT primary care model. Upon enrollment in the trial, patients will collaborate with their primary care provider to set a chronic disease management goal. Collaborative goal-setting has been shown to improve outcomes, but may not be sufficient for low-SES patients with multiple chronic conditions. Objectives: We will evaluate whether collaborative goal-setting plus IMPaCT is more effective than goal-setting alone at improving outcomes suggested to us by low-SES, chronically ill patients in focus groups: A. self-rated physical health (""feeling better and not having my health limit what I do""); B. chronic disease control (""improving my numbers""), mental health (""being happier""), quality of primary care (""having a good experience with my doctor's office""), patient activation (""feeling in control of my health"") and reducing hospitalizations; and C. we will also explore 1) whether the intervention works differently across various types of primary care settings, 2) whether the effects of the intervention last after it ends, 3) whether achieving health goals makes people feel better, and 4) what patients and CHWs think about the intervention and how it works. Methods: We will recruit 444 patients who 1) live in low-income communities, AND 2) have two or more of the following chronic conditions: diabetes, high blood pressure, obesity, or are smokers with asthma/emphysema. Half of these patients will be assigned to goal-setting alone and the other half will also receive six months of support from an IMPaCT CHW. Patient outcomes (projected): At the end of the six months, we will see which group had better outcomes. We expect that the patients who received IMPaCT will do better as measured by feeling physically healthier, achieving better chronic disease control, improving their mental health, having better quality of care, being more activated and requiring fewer hospitalizations.

20152047,Insurance instability and disparities in chronic disease outcomes,"Racial and ethnic health disparities in the processes and outcomes of chronic disease care are pervasive, well documented, and consistently linked to health insurance coverage. Insurance instability (the frequency of switches in insurance coverage or gaps without coverage), may contribute to disparities in outcomes of chronic disease care. With the explicit goal of reducing disparities, Massachusetts (MA) Health Insurance Reform has now extended comprehensive health insurance coverage to 98% of the state's residents, with disproportionately greater gains in coverage among racial/ethnic minorities and the poor. To examine if MA insurance reform has lessened health disparities through increased insurance stability, our specific aims are as follows. Aim 1 is to examine changes in insurance instability pre- and post-reform, overall and comparing racial/ethnic specific minority populations to whites. We hypothesize that (a) insurance instability decreased in the post-reform period and (b) insurance instability decreased more for racial/ethnic minorities. Aim 2 is to examine whether patients receiving care post-insurance reform had better processes of chronic disease management and improved health outcomes, compared with patients receiving care pre-insurance reform, and whether such patterns vary by race/ethnicity. We hypothesize that improvements in processes and outcomes of chronic disease management were greater among racial/ethnic minorities who benefited the most from insurance reform, resulting in reduced disparities. Aim 3 is to assess whether patients with more favorable insurance stability had better processes of chronic disease care and improved health outcomes compared to patients with less favorable insurance stability, and whether racial/ethnic minority patients experienced disproportionately greater gains. We hypothesize that greater insurance stability will be associated with improved processes and outcomes of chronic disease management, resulting in reduced disparities. We will conduct an innovative study to assess the processes and outcomes of care for six highly prevalent, chronic conditions before and after the implementation of MA Health Insurance Reform. These conditions are diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, congestive heart failure, asthma, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. We will utilize existing electronic medical records on over 110,000 subjects from Boston Medical Center and eight of its affiliated federally qualified community health centers, the largest safety net institution in New England that serves African American and Hispanic communities, and Tufts Medical Center, which serves a large Asian American community in Boston's Chinatown. When the study is completed, we will provide empiric data on the direct impact of insurance reform and insurance instability on health disparities in multiple populations.",1,,,,,1,,,massachusetts insurance reform,1
20152233,Patient and Provider Engagement and Empowerment Through Technology (P2E2T2) program to improve health in diabetes,"This proposal addresses the growing public health problem of diabetes, a disease that affects the ability of the body to process sugars from foods. For the patient, diabetes and its complications such as reduced vision and pain can affect quality of life and ability to function on a day-to-day basis in a serious way. The course of diabetes can be changed dramatically with lifestyle changes, such as healthy eating and increasing physical activity. However, traditional approaches (face-to-face counseling in clinics, individual visits with a diabetes educator, or group classes) are not sufficient to improve health in patients with diabetes. The overall goal of this proposal is to enhance the supports and resources available to patients with diabetes to assist them to achieve their health goals. We will develop and evaluate an innovative program using nurse health coaching using motivational interviewing techniques, wireless sensor and mobile health (mHealth) technology based on input from patient, provider, and technology experts as to how best to address the health care needs of persons living with diabetes and improve their health and wellness. Specific aims: Aim 1 is to partner with stakeholders (patients and providers) to revise and finalize the proposed intervention elements (nurse coaching, wireless sensor technology and mHealth framework, relevant outcomes). Aim 2 is to evaluate the feasibility and usefulness of integrating patient-generated goals and sensor data into a mHealth dashboard linked back into primary care practice. Aim 3 is to evaluate the effectiveness of the P2E2T2 program on diabetes management as measured by the following outcomes prioritized by patients in preliminary studies: quality of life, self-efficacy, readiness to change, and clinically relevant indicators. Relevance: The focus of this proposal is to attend to patient voice regarding what is needed from the health care team and from technology to optimally support patients to succeed in reaching self-identified health goals to better manage their diabetes. Diabetes management is ultimately in the hands of the patient who is expert on their own circumstances, motivations, and beliefs. Together, health care providers and technology can provide support, education, and coaching to assist patients to meet their goals. We anticipate iterative design of the program as we regularly involve our patient, provider, and technical expert stakeholders throughout the project. Current electronic health record (EHR) structure is focused on recording medical problems and the prescriptions providers generate, with no place to capture health goals set by the patient. We believe a fundamental shift is needed to not only include the patient in their care plan, but to highlight to the health care team through the electronic integration of an mHealth dashboard those areas which the patient identifies as holding the highest level of importance.",1,,1,,,,,,nurse health coaching to address care needs,1
20153077,Epidemiology and management of chronic kidney disease in South Asians,"The primary purpose of this proposal is to provide mentored guidance for Dr. Shuchi Anand as she becomes an independent clinician researcher. Dr. Anand is interested in kidney disease care in a global health context, particularly in highlighting the growing burden of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in low- and middle-income countries and in devising innovative strategies to manage CKD. Thus this proposal will study the epidemiology of CKD in South Asians and evaluate low-cost tools for its management in patients with diabetes. South Asians have recently been identified to be at high risk for insulin resistance in the form of diabetes and metabolic syndrome, with a four-fold higher prevalence and two-fold higher incidence of diabetes than U.S. whites. Yet limited data are available on one of the most important end-organ consequences, i.e., CKD. This proposal uses data from the Cardiometabolic Risk Reduction in South Asia (CARRS) study, a community-based cohort of adults living in New Delhi, Chennai, and Karachi, to study the prevalence and incidence of CKD, with the hypothesis that insulin resistance will be the primary risk factor for CKD even among South Asians living in a resource-constrained setting. To evaluate the extent to which management of risk factors such as blood glucose and blood pressure plays a role in determining the burden of CKD, the study will compare CKD prevalence in CARRS with CKD prevalence in South Asians living in the U.S. (where risk factors are expected to be better managed). A pooled dataset will be created from the Mediators of Atherosclerosis in South Asians Living in America (MASALA) study and the Pan Asian Cohort (PAC) Research Database to perform this analysis. In addition, the study will explore which markers of body size (waist circumference, waist-to-hip ratio, or body mass index) and of insulin resistance (fasting glucose, hemoglobin A1C, or fasting insulin levels) best predict new onset CKD among South Asians. The final aim of this proposal is to create a sub-study within an ongoing randomized control trial in five sites in rural India. The sub-study will evaluate a structured education intervention by a lay health worker in motivating patients with diabetes to seek care after undergoing a screening urine dipstick, which will be used as a tool to identify high-risk (proteinuric) patients, as well as to discuss the end-organ consequences of diabetes. A qualitative survey of patients and providers will also be performed to identify barriers to care. The overall goal is to report on the burden of CKD among South Asians and attempt to manage it with low-cost strategies. With this proposal, Dr. Anand will advance her epidemiology skills by working on analyses from the CARRS, MASALA, and PAC databases. She will obtain additional training in health services research via didactic coursework and on-the-ground project implementation. Throughout the process, she will receive training and guidance from experts in global health, nephrology, health policy, and biostatistics as she builds a strong foundation for a productive research career.",1,,1,,,,,,lay health worker intervention,1
20153101,Impact of emerging health insurance designs on diabetes complications,"Complications of diabetes such as retinopathy, renal failure, amputation, stroke, and myocardial infarction have a major impact on the wellbeing of patients with diabetes and cause high rates of death. To delay progression of complications, control symptoms, and prevent mortality, a spectrum of medical care is needed, including high acuity physician visits, advanced diagnostic tests, and invasive therapy. A rapidly growing form of health coverage--high-deductible insurance--substantially increases patients' out-of-pocket costs for such services. Families in high-deductible health plans must pay up to $12,000 per year before more comprehensive coverage begins. High cost-sharing levels are intended to encourage more efficient and higher quality care but could also reduce access to services that treat complications and save lives. It is essential to understand how high-deductible health plans affect micro- and macrovascular outcomes in diabetes. Suboptimal access could reduce detection of complications, accelerate disease progression, and increase deaths. This proposal seeks to assess the impact of high-deductible health plans on micro- and macrovascular diabetes complications and on the care that affects them, including physician visits, diagnostic testing, and major therapies. Our measure of physician visits will comprise outpatient and emergency department visits with specific diagnoses potentially related to diabetes complications, and we will classify emergency department visits as high or lower severity. The diagnostic tests we will examine include retinal imaging, renal biopsy, peripheral angiography, advanced brain imaging, and cardiac catheterization. We will further assess whether tests for coronary heart disease are used inappropriately to screen patients with diabetes. Our composite measure of therapy for macrovascular complications will include lower extremity bypass grafting, thrombolysis, and coronary artery stenting. To assess health outcomes, we will examine a composite measure of microvascular complications assessing treatment for advanced retinopathy and need for dialysis or renal transplant. Our composite macrovascular outcome will include lower extremity amputation, myocardial infarction, stroke, and death. This study will include a 15-year rolling sample of 71,000 diabetes patients whose employers mandated a switch from traditional to high-deductible health plans. We will use employer- and member-level propensity score matching to minimize selection bias. The study will employ strong quasi-experimental designs including interrupted time series with comparison series and Kaplan-Meier survival curves to examine outcomes of interest. This project will be the first to examine these research questions on a national scale.",1,,,,,1,,,high deductible health plans,1
20153177,REAL HEALTH-Diabetes (REach Ahead for Lifestyle and Health-Diabetes),"The twin epidemics of obesity and diabetes affect most Americans: 70% of US adults are overweight or obese, 26 million have diabetes, and 79 million people have pre-diabetes. While diet and exercise improve outcomes in diabetes, most people with type 2 diabetes eat an unhealthy diet, do little physical activity, and have trouble making and sustaining changes in health behavior. The Look AHEAD trial demonstrated that an intensive lifestyle intervention that teaches skills necessary to make changes in diet and activity led to sustained weight loss, diabetes remission, lower rates of complications, medication reduction, and improved physical fitness and quality of life compared to diabetes support and education. This project will adapt the highly effective but resource-intensive Look AHEAD intensive lifestyle intervention so that it may be delivered with fewer resources in community health center settings, potentially via telephone, greatly expanding its potential reach and impact. Pilot data show feasibility and effectiveness comparable to the Look AHEAD lifestyle intervention: lifestyle group participants lost 6.7% of body weight compared to 2.6% in the individual medical nutrition therapy (MNT) arm (P=0.003) and had twice as much reduction in medications. In this project, we will compare two different implementation strategies for delivery of this group adaptation of the Look AHEAD intensive lifestyle intervention, one using an in-person approach and one using a telephone approach, to dietitian referral for individual medical nutrition therapy in overweight patients with type 2 diabetes. The interventions will take place at three community health centers. Outcomes will be measured at baseline, 6, 12, 24, and 36 months. Aim 1 is to evaluate the comparative effectiveness of the adapted Look AHEAD lifestyle change interventions in a three-arm trial comparing random assignment to in-person (IP) group (n=70) and telephone conference call (TCC) group (n=70) implementation strategies to standard of care defined as individual MNT (control; n=70). Medical outcomes will include weight loss (primary), glycemic control, cardiac risk factors, medication dose, and cost. Behavioral outcomes include self-efficacy and health-related quality of life. Aim 2 is to evaluate the reach, adoption, implementation fidelity, and maintenance of the adapted Look AHEAD lifestyle change program in in-person and telephone call implementation strategies at the three community health center settings, comparing factors across centers using the RE-AIM Model Dimension items checklist and employing a mixed-methods approach, including focus groups and structured interviews. Aim 3 is to estimate the incremental cost per percentage point decrease in body weight of the implementation strategies assessed in this study compared to usual care. If effective, materials with estimates of approximate implementation costs from this project can be readily disseminated for use in usual care settings throughout the United States.",1,1,1,,,,,,individual vs. consultation interventions,1
20153190,Participatory design of patient-centered depression and diabetes care,"There is a pressing need to improve outcomes for patients with diabetes, especially patients from underserved communities. Patients with diabetes have high levels of depressive symptoms that lead to poor engagement in care and worse overall health function. Integrated care for depression and diabetes has been shown to help improve clinical outcomes. However, many patients with depressive symptoms and diabetes, especially traditionally underserved groups, have other priorities such as financial, social, and emotional concerns that affect their care. This K18 career enhancement award in patient-centered outcomes research (PCOR) proposes, through a program of mentoring, formal coursework, and a linked research project, to build skills in PCOR methods and utilize a participatory approach to inspire a new services delivery model for diabetes care. The basis of this model would be to include patients' nonbiomedical needs as part of primary care treatment discussions and decisions. Partnering with patients, physicians, and licensed practical nurses (LPNs) as stakeholders, our first phase will use mixed-methods to determine the range of biomedical (physical symptoms, diet, and exercise) and nonbiomedical (financial, social and emotional) needs patients with depressive symptoms and type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) may wish to address in the context of their health. These needs will be used to populate a prioritization card-sort task that will be used to create a personalized management plan that empowers patients to prioritize their own needs within an integrated care intervention. The second phase will prepare for a pragmatic comparative effectiveness trial by pilot testing an integrated depression and type 2 DM intervention plus patient prioritized planning in primary care patients with depressive symptoms and type 2 DM and a hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) > 8% from urban clinics serving primarily older low-income minority populations. Function will be our primary patient-centered outcome because of the importance patients place on being able to manage one's life circumstances. The intervention is carried out by health care staff already on site, thus facilitating its implementation in real-world practices with limited resources and competing demands. Our goal is to close the health disparities gap in diabetes care among traditionally underserved groups including older adults, those in inner city areas, and members of minority groups.",1,1,,,,,,,intervention card sorting to help patients prioritize needs,1
20153220,Understanding and honoring patients with multiple chronic conditions,"Current systems of care are not meeting the needs of older patients with multiple chronic health conditions. These patients receive more conflicting medical advice, and experience worse quality of life, more physical disability, more adverse drug events, and higher mortality than those without multimorbidity. Patients with multiple chronic conditions often face competing and conflicting health demands: for example, a person with diabetes may get advice to exercise but pain from arthritis or shortness of breath from lung disease can limit activity. To get the best care, patients with several chronic illnesses must communicate what is most important to them to their doctors and other health care providers, and doctors must understand and support patients' priorities for care. Unfortunately, we often do not talk to patients about their priorities or make them a part of care. We need care plans that include patients' priorities and tools for sharing them with all caregivers. But first, we must understand what shapes the priorities of patients with multiple chronic conditions and how these priorities can be supported by health care providers. In this project, experts in chronic disease care, health information technology, and participatory design methods will first study how patients with multiple chronic conditions understand and set priorities for care. The results will be used in a design process in which patients, their family caregivers, and their health care providers will develop a prototype interactive priority plan to be shared between patients and providers. The project focuses on patients with diabetes, who have some combination of osteoarthritis, coronary artery disease, and depression. Based on increasing national implementation of meaningful use requirements, we envision the documentation and communication of a patient's priorities to eventually be integrated within an electronic health record shared between patients and healthcare providers. Our study, however, will establish when paper, telephone, and in-person communications are needed to ensure common understanding and ongoing communication between patients and providers. We will also evaluate our novel use of participatory design methods to inform their potential wider use in projects that improve chronic care. Our project will help patients, caregivers, and doctors manage complex personal health information, and guide information technology developers on the design elements that are important for incorporating patient priorities into electronic health records.",1,1,,,,,,,what shapes patient priorities,1
20153232,Culturally adapted Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) intervention for Mexican Americans in primary care: an RCT,"Background: Latinos are the largest and fastest growing minority group (16% of the U.S. population) and provide a potent example of existing health disparities among U.S. racial/ethnic groups. In particular, Mexican Americans--the largest U.S. Latino subpopulation--have a notably higher prevalence of overweight and obesity (80%) than non-Hispanic whites (NHWs, 68%), and they are disproportionately affected by obesity-related risk factors (e.g., metabolic syndrome, pre-diabetes) and diseases (e.g., diabetes). Until efficacious lifestyle interventions for weight management are translated into practice, obesity and its comorbidities will continue to exact enormous and disproportionate burdens. Population-specific interventions are needed because undifferentiated interventions (often developed in white-dominant populations) may be inefficient--or even unintentionally increase health disparities. The Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) trial demonstrated that an intensive lifestyle intervention reduced type 2 diabetes incidence by 58% among high-risk adults and that weight loss was the dominant predictor. Numerous DPP translation studies have been undertaken, including a pragmatic randomized trial our team recently completed (""E-LITE"") with 241 participants (78% NHW) that showed success in integrating group counseling with health information technology (HIT) to operationalize the DPP intervention in primary care. To date, very few DPP translation studies have targeted Latinos. Design: We propose to culturally adapt the IT-enhanced group DPP intervention from E-LITE and test it among Spanish-speaking or bilingual Mexican Americans who are overweight or obese and have metabolic syndrome, pre-diabetes, or both. Participants (n=186) from 6 primary care practices in Santa Cruz, California (35% Latino residents; 91% of Mexican origin) will be randomly assigned to receive the culturally adapted intervention (CAI) or usual care. The primary aim is to determine the effectiveness of the CAI (""E"" in the RE-AIM model). We hypothesize that the CAI will lead to a greater mean reduction in body mass index at 24 months (primary outcome) vs. usual care. Secondary outcomes will include cost-effectiveness, clinical (e.g., fasting glucose), psychosocial (e.g., quality of life), behavior change (e.g., diet, physical activity) measures. The secondary aim is to conduct a process evaluation with mixed methods for the other RE-AIM attributes: Reach (e.g., participation rate of the target population); Adoption (e.g., participating clinic and provider characteristics); Implementation (e.g., intervention fidelity); and Maintenance (e.g., sustainability in the practice setting). Implications: This health services research project (PA-13-045) falls within the AHRQ Research Portfolio areas of comparative effectiveness, HIT, and prevention and care management; it also targets a priority population. The findings will be of value to clinicians, patients, and other decision makers considering effective obesity and diabetes prevention programs for the millions of MAs who carry a disproportionate burden of these, with high potential for real-world applicability and impact on MA minority health and policies aimed to eliminate health disparities.",1,1,1,,,,,,DPP translation to latinos,1
20153251,Use of Dose Safety Controller (DSC) artificial pancreas in subjects with hypoglycemia unawareness,"The objective of this project is to demonstrate that the Dose Safety Controller (DSC) improves the health and lives of persons with type 1 diabetes (T1D) that have become unaware of hypoglycemia. This research aims to show that an artificial pancreas (AP) device using the DSC will 1) safely and effectively control blood glucose for T1D patients with hypoglycemic unawareness, 2) restore awareness of hypoglycemia and cognitive performance after three weeks and maintain awareness at three months, and 3) improve the quality of life and emotional symptoms to the end of the study. This is accomplished through studies conducted at three locations: a) in a hospital clinical research center (CRC), b) in a guarded outpatient setting, and c) in an unguarded outpatient setting at home. Five study scenarios will be used: 1) a 24-hour CRC study using the DSC with constant medical and engineering monitoring with controlled food and exercise, 2) followed for three weeks without use of the DSC on self-care to establish statistical control, 3) closely monitored for three days in a hotel using the DS, 4) followed for 18 days of guarded study at home using the DSC, and 5) followed for the remainder of three months in an unguarded outpatient setting at home using the DCS. Through this progression it is expected that the DSC will automatically keep the participant's blood glucose level within near normal range, which is expected to restore the participant's awareness of the onset of hypoglycemia. Restoration of hormone response to low blood glucose will be tested using the hypoglycemia unawareness assessment (HUA) prior to use of the DSC at three weeks (end of study 2) at the end of the guarded study at home (study 4) and at three months (end of study 5). Patient-reported outcomes and cognitive function will be assessed at the same times. It is expected that improved glucose control provided by the DSC will be reflected in increased awareness of the onset of hypoglycemia. The ultimate business goal of Dose Safety is the incorporation of the DSC software in a commercialized AP device. These studies could validate the use of an AP by a specific group of patients, which could lead to acceptance by the medical field and insurance companies of its use by those who have lost their awareness of hypoglycemia. It is expected that the successful completion of these studies will validate the use of the DSC software in subsequent pivotal trials of a prototype commercial AP device.",1,1,,,,,,,dose safety controller,1
20181310,"Patient medical history representation, extraction, and inference from electronic health record (EHR) data","The significance of developing tools for automatically harvesting temporal constraints of clinical events from electronic health records (EHR) cannot be overestimated. Efficient analysis of the temporal aspects in EHR data could boost an array of clinical and translational research, such as disease progression studies, decision support systems, and personalized medicine. One big challenge we are facing is to automatically untangle and linearize the temporal constraints of clinical events embedded in highly diverse large-scale EHR data. Barriers to temporal data modeling, normalization, extraction, and reasoning have precluded the efficient use of EHR data sources for event history evaluation and trending analysis: (1) the current federally supported EHR data normalization tools do not focus on the time aspect of unstructured data yet; (2) existing time models focus only on structured data with absolute time, lack of supporting reasoning systems, or only offer application-specific partial solutions which cannot be adopted by the complex EHR data; and (3) current temporal information extraction approaches are either difficult to be adopted to EHR data, not scalable, or only offer application-specific partial solutions. This proposed project fills in the current gaps among ontologies, natural language processing (NLP), and EHR-based clinical research for temporal data representation, normalization, extractions, and reasoning. We propose to develop novel approaches for automatic temporal data representation, normalization, and reasoning for large, diverse, and heterogeneous EHR data and prepare the integrated data for further analysis. We will build new reasoning and extraction capacities on our TIMER (Temporal Information Modeling, Extracting, and Reasoning) framework to provide an end-to-end, open-source, standard-conforming software package. TIMER will be built on strong prior work by our team. We will develop new features in our CNTRO (Clinical Narrative Temporal Relation Ontology) for semantically defining the time domain and representing temporal data in complex EHR data. On top of the new developed CNTRO semantics, we will implement temporal relation reasoning capacities to automatically normalize temporal expressions, compute and infer temporal relations, and resolve ambiguities. We will leverage existing NLP tools and work on top of these tools to develop new extraction approaches to fill in the current gaps between NLP approaches and ontology-based reasoning approaches. We will adapt the SHARPn EHR data normalization pipeline and cTAKES for extracting and normalizing clinical event mentions from clinical narratives. We will explore an innovative approach for temporal relation extraction and event coreference, and make it work with the TIMER framework. We will evaluate the system using diabetes mellitus (DM) and colorectal cancer (CRC) patient cohorts from two institutions. Each component will be tested separately first followed by an evaluation of the whole framework. Results such as precision, recall, and f-measure will be reported.",1,,,,,,1,,temporal contraint identification? ,1
20183300,Unidas por la Vida: a healthy lifestyle intervention for high-risk Latina dyads,"Approximately half of Mexican American women report having a sedentary lifestyle, and nearly 78 percent are overweight or obese. Compared to women in all other ethnic groups, Mexican American women have the highest lifetime risk of type 2 diabetes. The development of culturally appropriate lifestyle interventions for this population is an urgent priority, and the proposed study accordingly will investigate a novel dyadic intervention designed to improve health behaviors and promote weight loss in two at-risk members of the same family: Mothers with type 2 diabetes and their overweight/obese adult daughters who are at risk for developing diabetes. The intervention, Unidas por la Vida (United for Life), capitalizes on the importance of the family in Latino culture to mobilize an existing family dyad as a source of mutual support that is likely to foster greater and longer-lasting health behavior change. The study builds on a successful pilot study (R34 DK083500) that established the feasibility and acceptability of this dyadic behavioral lifestyle intervention in a high-risk sample of Mexican American family members who share a risk for diabetes and its complications. The 16-week intervention was modeled after the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP), but was adapted for use with mother-daughter pairs and to be community-based and, thus, more easily accessible to low-income Latinas. Preliminary data from the Unidas pilot study indicated that the dyadic intervention promoted significant weight loss. The proposed study extends the successful pilot study to 1) target weight loss > 5 percent of baseline body weight and to foster maintenance using a tapered intervention, 2) add comparison groups that permit evaluation of the improvement uniquely associated with the partner intervention, and 3) assess theoretically derived mediators of the intervention. Participants (N=460 mother-adult daughter dyads) will be randomized into one of three conditions: 1) dyadic (mother-daughter) participation in a Unidas partner intervention (arm 1); 2) individual participation (mothers alone; unrelated daughters alone) in a Unidas individual intervention (arm 2); and 3) mother-daughter dyad in a usual care only condition (arm 3). The primary outcome is weight loss. Secondary outcomes include physical activity, dietary intake, physiological measures (e.g., HbA1c, LDL), body composition, quality of life, cost, and process evaluation. It is hypothesized that both the partner and individual interventions will produce significantly greater weight loss at 6, 12, and 18 months following program initiation than will the usual care only condition, with women assigned to the partner intervention losing more weight and maintaining the weight loss longer than women assigned to the individual intervention.",1,1,1,,,,,,"dyadic vs. individual self management, Latinas",1
20191322,Staying Strong and Healthy for androgen deprivation therapy for Latino men,"Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is increasingly being used to treat prostate cancer in the neoadjuvant and adjuvant contexts with radiation therapy (RT), for recurrence following primary treatment with surgery or radiation, or when the prostate cancer is at an advanced stage. This becomes highly significant considering that prostate cancer is the most commonly diagnosed noncutaneous cancer in American men. Of particular concern are Latino men, because Latinos are the fastest growing minority in the United States (US). Latino men are diagnosed with later stage disease, making them more likely to be treated with ADT. Studies have shown that men on ADT are at increased risk for vasomotor symptoms, depression, fatigue, diminished health-related quality of life (HRQOL), decreased bone mineral density (BMD), sexual dysfunction, metabolic syndrome, increased fat mass, along with decreased lean muscle mass, increased serum lipids, and decreased arterial compliance, all of which places them at higher risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD), osteoporosis, and type II diabetes. Latinos more often have obesity, dyslipidemia, low cardiovascular fitness, hypertension, and diabetes. Therefore, we propose to test our Staying Strong and Healthy program to promote healthy activity and nutrition during ADT for Latino men. Using a mixed-methods design we aim to (1) compare pre- and post-intervention BMI, lipids, waist/hip circumference, and glucose within and between 75 Latino men starting ADT who are randomly assigned to receive the Staying Strong and Healthy intervention and 75 Latino men starting ADT randomly assigned to receive usual care; (2) compare pre- and post-intervention HRQOL using the SF-12 subscales of emotional and physical well-being and disease-specific HRQOL using the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC) within and between groups; (3) develop and compare explanatory models of Latino men's activity and nutrition choices between those receiving the intervention and those receiving usual care; and (4) evaluate acceptability and benefit of the intervention from the perspective of participants. Latino men will be recruited from several sites serving predominantly Latino populations in Los Angeles. Men will come to University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) Center for Translational Research for baseline, 6, and 12 months measures and interview at 12 months. Men assigned to the intervention group will receive initial assessment and education on nutrition and the exercise program immediately following baseline measures. They will then receive 12 weekly calls from a nurse coordinator/cultural liaison team to deliver focused information, establish individually tailored nutrition and activity goals, assess accomplishments of goals, and provide support. We will conduct qualitative interviews with 30 men from each group to assess the intervention from their perspective and to develop explanatory frameworks for decision process used relative to food and activity choices. Analysis will combine within- and between-group comparisons and grounded theory techniques.",1,1,1,,,,,,ADT therapy,1
20152700,Cardiovascular (CV) benefits and safety of glucose-lowering therapies in adults with diabetes,"Cardiovascular (CV) events are the most common cause of death in adults with type 2 diabetes. While the benefits and safety of commonly used blood pressure (BP) and cholesterol medications are well established, much less is known about the CV benefits and CV risks of commonly used glucose-control strategies involving treatment with multiple glucose-lowering agents. To address this important clinical and public health concern, this project examines detailed clinical data from 1.3 million adults with treated type 2 diabetes over a 13-year period to quantify the impact of specific combinations of glucose-lowering agents on myocardial infarction, stroke, CV mortality, total mortality, and congestive heart failure (CHF) hospitalizations. We test four comparative effectiveness hypotheses to determine whether major CV events are differentially related to (a) use of specific two-agent combinations of metformin with sulfonylurea (SU), thiazolidinedione (TZD), DPP-4 inhibitors, or GLP-1 receptor agonists; (b) use of specific two-agent combinations of metformin with SU, TZD, DPP-4 inhibitors, or GLP-1 receptors agonists when basal insulin is added; (c) addition of prandial insulin in subjects already using basal insulin; and (d) treatment with human insulin versus analog insulin. Analysis employs modern comparative effectiveness statistical approaches, including new user designs and marginal structural modeling (MSM) with inverse probability weighting (IPW) and targeted minimal loss-based estimation (TMLE) which, under certain conditions, allow proper adjustment for time-dependent confounders on the causal pathway between early exposures and clinical outcomes, as well as proper adjustment for selection bias due to informative censoring. The study results have the potential to substantially improve CV outcomes in millions of Americans with type 2 diabetes by identifying which commonly used glucose-lowering regimens maximize CV benefits and minimize CV risks.",1,1,,,,,,,medications on CVD events,1
20153021,Racial and ethnic differences in diabetes treatment and outcomes in US hemodialysis patients,"In hemodialysis (HD) patients with diabetes mellitus (DM), the risk of developing diabetes-related complications and mortality is high. However, data on the associations among diabetes control, treatment, and diabetes-related complications in HD patients with DM are extremely limited. In addition, racial and ethnic differences in these relationships have not been documented. Objectives: The objective of this observational study is to assess the relationship among glycemic control, oral antidiabetic drug (OAD) therapy, and both cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular outcomes in HD patients with DM. We will also explore racial and ethnic differences in these associations. Methods: We will use data from the U.S. Renal Data System and electronic medical records of DaVita, Inc., to conduct a retrospective cohort study of patients on HD with diabetes mellitus at a large national provider of dialysis services to examine the associations among HbA1c and various clinical outcomes (specific aims 1 and 2). A subset of these patients will be used for a comparative effectiveness study of patients receiving TZD or sulfonylurea monotherapy (specific aim 3). For the first two aims, we will use Cox proportional hazards models to assess the associations between HbA1c and time to primary outcomes of interest, and test for effect modification by race and ethnicity by including interaction terms and performing a Wald test. We will further explore contrasts between different racial and ethnic groups upon finding significant interaction terms. For specific aim 3, we will compare prevalent and incident users of TZDs to users of sulfonylureas by limiting all analyses to patients receiving monotherapy with one of these two drug classes. We will examine the association between OAD monotherapy (TZD vs. sulfonylurea) and HbA1c by performing a repeated-measures analysis using linear regression models with a robust sandwich estimator. We will also analyze the association between OAD monotherapy (TZD vs. sulfonylurea) and time to cardiovascular events and death using Cox proportional hazards models. We will further conduct as-treated and intention-to-treat analyses in addition to other sensitivity analyses, and employ advanced statistical methods, including propensity score techniques. Racial and ethnic differences in these associations will be investigated using the method described above for the first two aims. Significance: This research study will take advantage of an unusually large and detailed dataset of patients initiating HD. Due to the limited data on the associations among diabetes management and treatment, including glycemic control and OAD therapy, and diabetes complications in HD patients with DM, additional studies are warranted in this high-risk population. Moreover, our study will have the ability to investigate racial and ethnic differences in these associations as we capitalize on the enormous size of the database that will be available for analysis.",1,1,,,,,,,"race/ethnic differences in glycemic control, drugs, and CVD outcomes",1
20153072,TEEN HEED: an adolescent peer-led diabetes prevention intervention,"The number of youth with type 2 diabetes in the U.S. is projected to increase by a staggering 49 percent by 2050, with higher rates among minority youth. The Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) is recognized as a sentinel study demonstrating the effectiveness of lifestyle interventions for diabetes prevention among pre-diabetic adults but has not yet been replicated in youth. In addition, such intensive interventions are often not sustainable in high-risk communities with limited resources. One strategy that has been successfully employed in adults from such communities is peer-based health education. Research suggests that, like adults, young people are more likely to hear and personalize messages, and thus to change their attitudes and behaviors, if they believe the messenger is similar to them and faces the same concerns and pressures. However, there have been no peer-led interventions in ethnic minority teens and no interventions focused specifically on weight loss for diabetes prevention. Finally, another challenge identified in existing youth health intervention programs is keeping youth engaged to enhance program participation and impact. One potential strategy is the use of mobile technologies (text messaging, mobile applications, social media) to support weight management programs, but to date use of such technologies has not been studied in youth. This proposal's overall objective is to use community-based participatory research (CBPR) to develop and pilot test a youth peer-led diabetes prevention intervention incorporating novel mobile health technologies for at-risk adolescents in a vulnerable New York City community. The central hypothesis is that such an intervention will lead to maintenance or decrease in BMI; improved dietary, physical activity, and weight control behaviors; and a decrease in diabetes risk. The specific aims are to 1) explore strategies for using peer educators and novel mobile health technologies as part of a group lifestyle change program for diabetes prevention among at-risk ethnic minority youth in a New York City community with high disease burden; 2) design, pilot test, and evaluate preliminary outcomes for the intervention. Using data from aim 1, we will use CBPR to translate a proven adult peer-led diabetes prevention intervention into a developmentally and culturally appropriate lifestyle intervention for pre-diabetic ethnic minority adolescents. We will then screen at-risk adolescents for pre-diabetes and related lifestyle and biological measures and compare outcomes in pre-diabetic adolescents in intervention and wait list control groups to test intervention effectiveness; and 3) further refine the pilot intervention for a larger RCT based on an examination of intervention feasibility, acceptability, and sustainability.",1,,1,,,,,,peer led diabetes prevention intervention,1
20153329,Engaging at-risk minority women in health system diabetes prevention programs,"Preventing type 2 diabetes is a high priority for health care systems. Particular focus is needed on racial and ethnic minority populations who suffer disproportionately from diabetes and its complications. Success depends not only on patient access to lifestyle programs to reduce risk, but also on patient engagement in such programs. Yet evidence-based strategies to increase engagement in clinical settings are lacking. This K01 career development award will provide Susan D. Brown, PhD, with the expertise needed to achieve her long-term goal of reducing health disparities in diabetes by engaging diverse at-risk patients, such as overweight and obese women with a history of gestational diabetes, in preventive programs in health care settings. This proposal examines whether two theory-driven outreach strategies, tailored diabetes risk information and self-affirmation, impact three initial and sustained patient engagement outcomes: patient responses to outreach materials, and participation and retention in a lifestyle program. The central hypothesis is that diabetes risk information individually tailored to women's race/ethnicity and diabetes risk factors derived from electronic medical records may increase patient engagement. Yet tailored risk information can be psychologically threatening; thus its effects will be enhanced, and the threat mitigated, when individuals can affirm a sense of self-worth by actively reflecting on values that are important to them. Among overweight/obese women with a history of gestational diabetes, the specific aims are as follows. Aim 1 is to develop novel, interactive outreach materials to be used in the clinical setting containing tailored diabetes risk information and self-affirmation, in collaboration with patients and health system stakeholders. Aim 2 is to experimentally pre-test the impact of the developed outreach materials on patient responses in a 2 (tailored vs. non-tailored) x 2 (self-affirmation vs. no self-affirmation) design. Aim 3 is to experimentally pilot test the impact of interactive outreach materials on patient engagement in a health system lifestyle program, as compared to standard outreach; I will also explore effects on weight loss. This theory-based research in a real-world clinical setting will expand our limited knowledge base regarding patient engagement for diabetes prevention. Dr. Brown will benefit from the primary mentorship of Assiamira Ferrara, MD, PhD, Senior Research Scientist and Section Chief for Women's and Children's Health at the Kaiser Permanente Northern California Division of Research. Complementing Dr. Brown's strengths in clinical psychology and obesity treatment, this K01 award will provide systematic training overseen by experts in diabetes and diabetes prevention (Dr. Ferrara), implementation science (Constance Weisner, DrPH, MSW and Julie Schmittdiel, PhD), health disparities (Alyce Adams, PhD), and biostatistics (Charles Quesenberry, PhD) to ensure Dr. Brown's success as an independent diabetes prevention investigator.",1,1,,,,,,,tailored and affiratmation intervention,1
20154030,Translating the Diabetes Prevention Program to engage men in disadvantaged areas,"The rising epidemic of type 2 diabetes is a major cause of disability and death. With an estimated cost of $245 billion in 2012, diabetes also represents a significant burden to the U.S. health care system. Following the successful trial of the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) in 2002, the translation of this lifestyle intervention to community settings has been a major public health focus, with significant support from the CDC through the National Diabetes Prevention Program (NDPP). Although the NDPP has been shown to be effective for enrolled participants, resulting in weight loss of 5-7%, independent of setting and population group, there are striking disparities in engagement. Participation rates for men are particularly low (often <30% of a class); participation rates for black and Latino men are even lower (<20%). Men generally have poorer health outcomes and lower life expectancies than women. Men of color, who are more likely than their white counterparts to face significant disadvantage, experience higher rates of diabetes-related complications, such as cardiovascular disease and end-stage renal disease. Given the disproportionate burden of diabetes and its complications for disadvantaged groups, targeted diabetes prevention programming is a crucial component of public health planning. This proposal is for a translational, cluster randomized trial of the NDPP in 16 sites for the main study, tailored to recruit, engage, and retain men from disadvantaged communities in type 2 diabetes prevention. The proposed tailored program, the NDPPB, will first be pilot tested with 30 men in 2 sites before being implemented in 8 NYC Parks and Recreation Department (REC) sites in disadvantaged communities in each of the 5 boroughs of NYC, with 8 standard NDPP REC sites for comparison. Working in collaboration with a stakeholder advisory panel of community leaders and academic experts, we will conduct focused outreach to the target population. We will implement the evidence-based NDPP curriculum, with tailoring to promote increased engagement of men. For our proposal, ""engagement"" encompasses recruitment, group participation, and retention. We propose having male-only coaches and groups members, adaptations to the dietary messaging, and increased emphasis on physical activity. For comparison, the standard mixed-gender groups will be implemented at eight separate REC sites, matched by NYC borough, using the standard NDPP curriculum. In the main study, we will enroll a total of 830 participants (age 18 and older) across the 16 REC sites. The specific aims of the proposed study are 1) to assess the effectiveness of the NDPPB with respect to reductions in BMI (primary outcome) compared to the standard NDPP model. We hypothesize that men engaged in the NDPPB will have reductions in BMI at 16 weeks at least equivalent to those in the standard NDPP; 2) to examine the extent to which recruitment/enrollment, intervention, and retention strategies tailored for men at risk for type 2 diabetes in disadvantaged communities are associated with improved engagement of the target population (secondary outcomes). We hypothesize that implementation of the NDPPB will proceed with more rapid recruitment and enrollment of men than in the standard NDPP; 3) to identify demographic, psychosocial, neighborhood, and REC site characteristics associated with differential recruitment and intervention effects; and 4) to provide estimates of incremental costs of the NDPPB in comparison to the standard community-based NDPP programs and relative to the primary outcome of change in BMI. Strengths of our proposal include rigorous design and analytic methodologies, with randomization by site, a participatory approach, and an adaptive process for development of our intervention with the NYC REC sites, along with a strong community and expert advisory panel. If our hypotheses are supported, this study will inform real-world implementation of the NDPP program in community settings for high-risk men and make a significant contribution to reducing the diabetes burden in these populations. Public health relevance: The public health relevance of this proposal is that although the National Diabetes Prevention Program (NDPP) has been shown to be effective in preventing or delaying type 2 diabetes for enrolled participants, there are disparities in enrollment and engagement by men, especially those from disadvantaged communities. If our hypotheses are supported, this study with its recruitment strategies and adapted curriculum will inform real-world implementation of the NDPP program in accessible community settings for men and will make a significant contribution to reducing the diabetes burden in these high-risk populations.",1,,1,,,,,,targeted diabetes prevention program in groups,1

20171223,Improving clinical encounter communications to enhance minority diabetes care,"Disparities in health care delivery and outcomes have been linked, in part, to the difficulties physicians have in establishing effective communication with patients who differ from themselves in terms of race, ethnicity, and economic circumstances. Type 2 diabetes mellitus and pre-diabetic nutrition-based obesity are an important case in point. Racial and socioeconomic differences can impede doctors' ability to understand their patients' constraining realities, such as the complex tradeoffs and decision strategies involved in daily activities like purchasing food and medications. When clinical encounters about diabetes diagnosis and management are not tailored to the patient's pragmatic realities, they become less likely to lead to a shared understanding of what needs to be done. This can, in turn, lead physicians to perceive that minority patients are non-compliant and ignoring their advice. To be effective, these encounter-based discussions about care, behavior, and self-care require a dialog that is adaptive to the cultural assumptions, cognitive/emotional concerns, and systemic socioeconomic constraints of the individual patient. This area is in need of improvement--clinicians treating populations affected by health disparities must possess the competencies to understand how to frame and tailor their dialogs to the unique needs of these patients. The system we envision--Realizing Enhanced Patient Encounters through Aiding and Training (REPEAT)--will provide an innovative alternative to current (very minimal) training. It encapsulates best practices in a low-cost, ubiquitously accessible system based on experiential learning. REPEAT will offer a realistic virtual environment that allows learning to occur through simulated interactions with synthetic standardized patients (SSPs). These are interactive computer-generated avatars that can act and react realistically (via verbal and via nonverbal) to clinician communications during an office visit. Emerging cognitive simulation technology will imbue the SSPs with attributes (e.g., environmental and economic limitations, beliefs, attitudes, fears) that are representative of shared characteristics of a specific patient subpopulation. Phase I built a preliminary REPEAT prototype as a limited set of virtual clinical encounters and experimentally assessed it using a sample of graduating medical students. The assessment showed significant improvement in communication performance (using multiple measures) after only a few hours of practice in REPEAT virtual encounters as guided by REPEAT's proactive coaching, reactive feedback and other forms of tutoring. Phase II will develop a full curriculum to teach knowledge and skills needed to engage low-income African Americans with T2D or pre-diabetic obesity and productively adapt treatment plans to the socioeconomic barriers they face. Phase II will also develop commercializable software tools to create and deliver this and other REPEAT curricula. The technology has the potential to be translated to broad usage, including a version usable by patients, and to reduce health care disparities by improving communication among providers and patients.",1,,,1,,,,,training providers to interact with their patients in a culturally appropriate way,1
20151123,Understanding geographic variations in preventable hospitalizations,"Background: Diabetes is a common chronic condition among veterans requiring regular health care visits to both primary care providers and specialists. Although the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) offers a spectrum of integrated health care services, most veterans utilize both VHA and private sector health care providers. As has been reported, this dual system use has the potential to impede coordination of care and may result in poorer outcomes. On the other hand, having coverage for services in two systems may result in increased choice and improved access to care for some veterans. Preventable hospitalizations (PHs) are considered a reflection of poor quality ambulatory care and lack of access to timely primary care. Using PHs as our outcome of interest, we attempted to assess the impact of dual system use on the health outcomes of veterans with diabetes dually enrolled in VHA and Medicare. Given the previously reported low reliance of veterans on VHA ambulatory care, we also evaluated the association between reliance on VHA ambulatory care and veterans' outcomes. In addition, we explored variability in state-level VHA and private sector preventable hospitalization rates in our cohort. Objectives: Our specific aims are 1. among veteran clinic users with diabetes, examine the role of fragmented care at the veteran level and care coordination at the facility level on the risk of preventable hospitalizations; 2. among veteran clinic users with diabetes, analyze veteran-level and facility-level factors associated with the relationship between preventable hospitalizations and health care expenditures; and 3. develop prototype user-friendly maps of geographic variation in health care expenditures, dual VHA/Medicare use, and preventable hospitalizations among VHA users with diabetes. Methods: Using data from VHA Corporate Data Warehouse (CDW) and the VA Information Resource Center (VIReC) Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services, we conducted a dynamic retrospective cohort study with calendar years 2004-2010 serving as the study period. The study population consisted of veterans with diabetes mellitus, aged 66 years or older, and dually enrolled in VHA and Medicare. Our outcome of interest was any PH experienced by the patient during the outcome years 2006-2010, adapted from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality's (AHRQ) definition of the Prevention Quality Indicators (PQI). We defined reliance on VHA as the proportion of all non-urgent outpatient visits that were made to VHA facilities (VHA visits/[VHA visits + Medicare visits]). We adapted the fragmentation of care index used by Liu et al.: ([total outpatient visits]^2 - ([number of Medicare outpatient visits]^2 + [number of VHA outpatient visits]^2) / (total outpatient visits*[total outpatient visits - 1]). For state-level analyses, we aggregated patient information to the state level. We calculated PH rates (PHRs) by dividing the total number of unique patients in each state who experienced at least one episode of a PH during the outcome year by the number who were hospitalized during the outcome year. We distinguished between total PHR (Medicare and VHA PHR combined) and system-level PHR (i.e., Medicare PHR and VHA PHR). We used global Moran's I and the Univariate LISA to identify and locate clustering of PHRs among states. We used multivariable ordinary least squares regression (controlling for age and sex), and geographically weighted regression and a generalized additive model (controlling for geographic patterns) to evaluate the association between reliance on VHA ambulatory care and PHRs at the state level. We used a logistic regression model to measure the association between PHs and care fragmentation while controlling for demographic characteristics, socioeconomic status, comorbidities, and intermediate-level health measures at the patient level, patient population size and care coordination measures at the facility level, and area resource measures at the county level. We performed this analysis for outcome years 2008-2010 using only the hospitalized subjects in our cohort. Care coordination was measured at the assigned facility based on responses to the 2007 VHA Clinical Practice Organizational Survey (CPOS) administered by Yano et al. Findings: The cohort (sample size range: 529,031 to 576,500 for each outcome year) primarily consisted of males aged 73-77 years. Of those patients who utilized inpatient services (sample size range: 149,027 to 155,553), 17% or less had at least one hospital stay at a VHA facility. The cohort's reliance on VHA ambulatory care at the state level ranged from 13.92% to 67.78%. Approximately 30% of those hospitalized experienced at least one preventable hospitalization during any given outcome year. The state-level total PHR varied from 21% to 37% from 2006 to 2010. The VHA PHR ranged from 18-60%. The Medicare PHR ranged from 19-38%. We found significant clustering of low total PHR and Medicare PHR (global Moran's I > 0.20; p-value < 0.05 in all years) among states in the western US from 2006 to 2010. A cluster of high total PHRs and MC PHRs was inconsistently present around the states of Illinois, Indiana, and Ohio. Our findings are consistent with state-level PHRs reported for Medicare enrollees in the general population. Reliance on VHA ambulatory care was generally not associated with PHRs at the state level. We found residence in highly rural areas (highly rural vs. urban: OR=1.25, CI:1.13-1.39) to be positively associated with PHs. We did not find a significant association between facility-level care coordination measures and PHs. There are two possible explanations for this. First, our care coordination measures were based on self-reports from providers, which may be biased based on their perception. Second, given that most of our subjects received more than two-thirds of their care in the private sector, care coordination efforts in the VHA may have limited impact PHs, most of which also occur in the private sector. We found an unexpected association between greater care fragmentation and lower risk of PHs (OR=0.72, CI: 0.66-0.78). Almost all previous studies have measured care fragmentation at the provider level and/or have accounted for the sequence of visits between various providers. Since our measure of care fragmentation detects care dispersion at the system level, we may be measuring care access rather than care fragmentation with our index. Impact: Our findings indicate the importance of considering both VHA and private sector health care utilization in assessing outcomes and for resource allocation and health care delivery. Further analysis is necessary to clarify the context in which fragmentation and coordination measures are reliable.",1,1,,1,,,,,individual and facility level factors on hospitalizations,1
20152176,Bilingual foto-tabloids in community newspapers,"Diabetes among Hispanics has reached epidemic proportions. Pre-diabetes education is key in diabetes prevention and control yet education tools that translate into culturally engaging, yet simple and easy-to-understand information is a challenge for Hispanics. Limited health literacy, lack of English-language proficiency, trouble accessing healthcare, and socio-cultural barriers represent great disparities for this underserved population. As of 2010, the Hispanic population in the United States reached 50 million, comprising over 16.7% of the U.S. population and rural Hispanics comprise 6.3% of the nation's non-metro inhabitants. Almost 25% of the Hispanic population in the U.S. does not speak English and accessing important health information about diabetes prevention and control and other chronic diseases eludes them. The challenge is compounded as health providers attempt to educate and inform the 3.2 million Hispanics living in rural areas of the country, as they are even more isolated than those Hispanics in metro areas. Fotonovelas, a popular Latin American storytelling medium are stories told with photos and dialogue bubbles. Because fotonovelas are entertaining, graphic, and colorful, and have a minimum of text\i[yu they are intrinsically easy to read. Originally a pop culture entertainment medium in Latin America, fotonovelas are popular and well received among U.S. Hispanics and they have proven to be effective health education tools. This phase I SBIR application is a collaboration among ACMA Social Marketing, the most experienced producer of health education fotonovelas in the U.S., New Mexico Department of Health Diabetes Prevention and Control Program, Viridian Health, a national healthcare improvement company, and VisionQuest, a biomedical firm dedicated to preventing eye disease related to diabetes. The proposed innovation combines the potential of three popular, credible, and well-accepted communication agents to address Hispanic health disparities in rural areas: health fotonovelas, bilingual and/or community-based tabloid newspapers, and promotoras. Our innovation involves combining the health fotonovela with the community newspaper to iterate it into a ""foto-tabloid,"" effectively turning the community newspaper into a health information vehicle to reach out to underserved rural Hispanics. In this phase I period, we will use rural New Mexico as a test-bed and assess if foto-tabloids are more effective as outreach and health communication tools than the standard patient education pamphlet.",1,,,,1,,,,fotonovela in local newspapers to engage latino patients,1
20152181,Mobile health app to reduce diabetes in Latina women with prior gestational diabetes,"Despite Latinos being the largest ethnic minority, with almost 56.5 million Latinos living in the US, they are one of the most medically underserved groups. Latina women have one of the highest rates of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) in the U.S. Moreover, GDM is a major risk factor for type 2 diabetes (T2DM), with up to 60% of women developing T2DM within 10 years of a GDM pregnancy. Given the growing obesity epidemic, rates of GDM and T2DM are likely to increase in the absence of preventive interventions. Addressing the risk of T2DM after GDM is critical to reducing health disparities faced by Latina women. The postpartum period is widely recognized as representing a ""window of opportunity"" to improve the future health of women who have had complicated pregnancies, including GDM. However, delivery of preventive interventions is challenging due to systems-related factors, including lack of time and resources for providers to provide lifestyle modification counseling, as well as patient challenges, including multiple demands of the postpartum period, leaving little time for women to engage in preventive activities. Technology can help overcome these barriers, as demonstrated by the success of our web-based CDC-funded Balance after Baby (BAB) intervention, which successfully promoted weight loss in women with recent GDM. Qualitative results from BAB, which revealed that women strongly wanted the program delivered via an app, led us, in partnership with Latina women with recent GDM, to develop a phase I m-health intervention program for Latina women, called Hola Bebe, Adios Diabetes!, in which we tested the preliminary effectiveness of a mobile app in reducing risk factors for the development of T2DM in Latina women who had GDM in the prior 5 years. The proposed phase II application builds on the promising phase I results, which showed acceptability of the program, increased self-efficacy for healthy lifestyle, and weight loss in Latina women with recent GDM. Phase II specific aims are as follows: (aim 1) enhance Hola Bebe to include a) an IOS version, b) integrated databases and data analytics to enable population health management and reporting, and c) expanded content based on phase I participant recommendations; and (aim 2) evaluate the effectiveness of Hola Bebe in RCT with Latina women with recent GDM. We hypothesize that participants receiving Hola Bebe will show increased self-efficacy for healthy eating and physical activity (primary outcomes), greater weight loss (secondary outcomes), and a greater decrease in HbA1C levels (exploratory hypothesis) compared to controls. Successful achievement of study aims will result in a culturally tailored, user-centered, low-cost, high-reach, and easy-to-use evidence-based m-health intervention to reduce risk factors for T2DM in Latina women with a recent history of GDM. The intervention can help reduce the stark ethnic disparities in T2DM among the Latino population while providing a model for an m-health solution that addresses the many systems-based, time, and cost barriers to preventive care typically seen in community-based settings.",1,1,,,,,,,app for diabetes prevention - hola bebe,1
20152716,Nurse practitioners and physician assistants: primary care roles and outcomes,"Background: Expected primary care provider shortfalls threaten access to care in both the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) and the United States health care system. Meanwhile, deficiencies in quality and efficiency of primary care demand new approaches such as patient-aligned care team models. Expanded use of nurse practitioners (NPs) and physician assistants (PAs) offers a potential mechanism for addressing access, quality, and cost issues. Although the VHA has been a pioneer in adopting expansive roles for non-physician providers and VHA patient-aligned care teams (PACTs) can be led by NPs and PAs, there is limited information about how the work of patient care is divided among VHA providers and about how this division of labor affects care outcomes and costs. Because of potential differences in care provided by NPs and PAs, our study assessed each profession separately. We used diabetes as a tracer condition to evaluate care provided by primary care NPs, PAs, and physicians. Objectives: The project's purpose was to examine clinical roles of NPs, PAs, and physicians in VHA primary care of patients with diabetes and to assess the association of these roles with care outcomes and costs. The first aim characterized role patterns for allocation of patient care work among NPs, PAs, and physicians in the care of patients with diabetes in VHA primary care clinics. Secondly, we sought to compare quality of care outcomes for patients with diabetes across usual provider of care (UPC) types, and NP and PA roles, controlling for organizational characteristics and patient health status. Third, we evaluated patient-level health resource utilization and costs for patients with diabetes across UPC types, and NP and PA roles, controlling for initial health and organizational characteristics. Methods: Using retrospective analyses of secondary data, we examined the care of adult, pharmaceutically treated diabetes patients receiving care at primary care locations within the Veterans Affairs (VA) health care system in 2012 and 2013. A patient's usual provider of care was defined as the primary care provider most often visited in the primary care clinic in 2012. This analysis included patients with the same PCP in 2012 and 2013. We described the patterns of care and roles (usual provider vs. supplemental provider, type of care provided, and complexity of patients) of NPs, PAs, and physicians by patient and organizational characteristics. We examined associations between the profession and roles of the UPC and intermediate diabetes outcomes and control, health care utilization, and health care costs. Hierarchical linear mixed models and logistic regression models were used to analyze continuous and dichotomous outcomes respectively. These analyses accounted for patient- and organizational-level characteristics potentially associated with diabetes outcomes. Findings: Based on data from the VA Corporate Data Warehouse, there were 710,267 patients who met inclusion criteria including 1) an ICD 9 code for diabetes; 2) at least 1 pharmacy fill for diabetes medication in FY12; 3) at least 2 outpatient visits (or at least 1 inpatient visit) in FY12; 3) at least 1 outpatient visit in FY13; and 4) at least 1 primary care encounter with an MD, NP, or PA in FY12. These veterans received the largest portion of their primary care from 840 VA clinic locations meeting inclusion criteria. The most frequent primary care providers for patients in the VHA in FY12 (defined as the primary care provider most frequently seen in that year) were attending physicians (76% of patients), NPs (16% of patients), PAs (6% of patients), and resident physicians (2% of patients). Among the findings, no clinically significant differences were observed between outcomes of patients for physicians, NPs, and PAs. Compared to physicians: 1) mean HbA1c differences were -0.05% (-.07: 0.03) for NPs and 0.01% (95%CI= 0.02:0.03) for PAs; 2) mean SBP differences were -0.26mmHg (-.45: 0.07) for NPs and -0.25mmHg (-0.50:0.01) for PAs; and 3) mean LDL-C differences were 1.03mg/dl (0.59:1.48) for NPs and 1.77mg/dl (1.18:2.37) for PAs. Impact: Both the VHA and broader health care system in the United States are seeking ways to expand access to primary care. There has long been debate over the potential roles of non-physician primary care providers in addressing access issues. The VHA has recently expanded the clinical duties of nurse practitioners and continues to consider appropriate clinical roles of physician assistants. The results of this study provided important expanded evidence that NP and PA providers can achieve similar diabetes outcomes among their patients as physicians. As a result, it added to the body of evidence that NPs and PAs can and do have extensive roles in treating patients with chronic illness in primary care settings.",1,,,1,,1,,1,NP scope of practice within VA,1
20153110,Randomized trial of exercise promotion in primary care,"Diabetes is a devastating disease that is increasing in prevalence. Regular physical activity markedly improves health for all individuals, including those with diabetes and pre-diabetes. However, only 5% of American adults are sufficiently active to meet U.S. national guidelines. The health sector is an important setting to promote physical activity because of its ability to reach and influence large numbers of people. Previous trials in the primary care setting have been hindered by short-term interventions, insufficient intervention intensity, self-reported physical activity as the outcome, and non-generalizability of results. We propose a trial including members of Kaiser Permanente Southern California (KPSC), an integrated health plan with high racial/ethnic diversity and whose majority membership is Latino. We will build on an existing KP innovation of assessing physical activity at every outpatient visit by proposing a trial in which the primary care provider determines the suitability of a patient to increase physical activity, provides brief advice, and refers patients or physical activity counseling. Eligible patients are then recruited to a two-year, medium-intensity telephone behavioral counseling intervention or usual care. We focus the trial on adults who have pre-diabetes or diabetes who are not prescribed insulin because of their high risk for cardio-metabolic complications and the great benefit they can obtain from regular physical activity. The intervention, individualized by the motivational interviewing approach, is generalizable to other health care delivery systems. Electronic medical records will provide data for secondary outcomes. Our long-term goal is to determine if such a physical activity intervention can be successfully integrated into primary care services. If so, the intervention can be scaled so millions of sedentary patients with diabetes or pre-diabetes can receive personal advice and physical activity counseling. To this end, our primary aim is to determine if the study intervention, compared to usual care, increases physical activity (assessed by accelerometry) between baseline and 24 months in patients with type 2 diabetes or pre-diabetes. Our secondary aims are to 1) determine if the intervention improves body mass index (BMI), hemoglobin A1C, blood pressure, lipids, and quality of life; and 2) determine the cost-effectiveness of the intervention. This study has the potential for a very high impact on clinical preventive practices. Physical activity improves numerous diseases and conditions and is seriously neglected in primary care. By documenting the costs and effects of a practical intervention based in primary care on an objective measure of physical activity, this study will promote a highly significant shift in primary care practice.",1,1,1,,,,,,PA intervention ,1
20153242,Use of the track health function of the My HealtheVet personal health record,"Background: Prediabetes, which has reached epidemic levels in the U.S., is also prevalent among veterans, many of whom have already been diagnosed with diabetes. Although people with prediabetes have a 30% risk of developing primarily type 2 diabetes, they can reduce that risk by 60-70% through modifiable behavioral lifestyle changes, specifically, through improved dietary habits and increased physical activity (PA). Interventions intended for achieving these goals are needed that do not incur large costs in the form of professional staff that are required to manage and maintain the program, and which could reach individuals in rural areas or who cannot commute easily to clinics. My HealtheVet (MHV), a web-based personal health record (PHR) introduced by the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) intended for empowering patients to play a more active role in their health care, has a powerful interactive feature, Track Health (TH), designed to help its users adopt healthy dietary and physically active lifestyles and potentially understand how changes in these lifestyles may translate into positive health measures. Evidence indicates, however, that most veterans are either not aware of or do not use many of the functionalities, such as TH, that MHV has to offer. In this pilot study, we investigated the potential benefits of using this PHR's TH function for adopting positive lifestyle changes in a sample of overweight and obese veterans with prediabetes. Objectives: The primary goal of this study was to determine if a training intervention directed at helping veterans understand how to use and understand MHV's TH function, coupled with use of MHV's Secure Messaging (SM) feature to enable communication with study coordinators, can translate into actual adherence to PA and an improved diet. We were also interested in determining if this intervention would increase these individuals' self-efficacy, patient activation, and intent to adhere to PA and improved diet. Another objective was to determine if participants would adhere to use of MHV based on meeting criteria specified to them regarding making weight, PA, and diet entries in MHV's TH functions, and whether they would be satisfied with the longitudinal intervention trial. Methods: Thirty-eight veterans (29 males and 9 females, mean age 57.7, 24% Hispanic, 55% black) recruited from primary care clinics of the Miami Veterans Administration Medical Center (VAMC) completed this pilot study. Inclusion criteria included a diagnosis of prediabetes (HbA1c 5.7-6.4%, fasting plasma glucose 100-125 mg/dL or oral glucose tolerance test 140-199 mg/dL); older than 20 years of age; English speaking; had access to the internet; had a body mass index (BMI) of 25-42 kg/m; were not physically active three days per week for 20 minutes each time for the previous six months; were able to engage in a regular program of mild-to-moderate intensity PA but were not currently following a weight loss diet or participating in an intervention trial; and were not cognitively impaired or depressed. Assessments took place during each of four visits to a laboratory within the VAMC. The first visit included screening on study inclusion and exclusion criteria and training on use of MHV's TH function (nine people were excluded based on not meeting the study eligibility criteria). Participants also completed diet and PA self-efficacy and intention to adhere questionnaires, were given an accelerometer to wear over the next 7 days, and were asked to make food intake, PA, and weight entries a specified number of times into MHV over the next week. They were informed that if they failed to meet accelerator use and information entry criteria for the first week, they would not qualify for the study, but would receive $175 if they completed the entire study. During the participants' second (baseline) visit (week 1 of the study), accelerometer and MHV log data were obtained (five people did not meet the accelerometer use and four people did not meet the MHV information entry criteria). Participants had their weight, abdominal circumference, pulse, and systolic and diastolic blood pressure measured, and a dietary analysis computer program (Nutritional Data System for Research; NDSR) designed for the collection and analysis of 24-hour dietary recalls (from which a kcal dietary intake measure was computed) administered, followed by the administration of questionnaires for measuring health literacy, objective numeracy, graph literacy, patient activation (PAM), and the System Usability Scale (SUS), a 10-item questionnaire that provides a general assessment of the usability of a product (in this case, MHV) that could be compared to national norms. They were also provided with dietary guidelines and exercise regimens that they should incorporate into their lifestyle. During the third (week 12) visit, the PA and diet self-efficacy and intention to adhere questionnaires, as well as the NDSR, were administered a second time; measures of weight, abdominal circumference, pulse, and systolic and diastolic blood pressure were also collected. Participants were again given an accelerometer to wear over the following week. During participants' fourth (week 13) visit, the accelerometer data and MHV log data (over their 13-week period of participation in the study) were downloaded, the PAM was administered a second time, and a questionnaire that gauged satisfaction with various aspects of the study was administered. The primary outcome measures were the differences over the 3-month period (week 13-week 1) in weight (kg), abdominal circumference (inches), energy expenditure (measured in kcal/day using an accelerometer), dietary intake (kcal, 24-hour recall using the NDSR), and systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Three-month differences in diet and PA self-efficacy and intention to adhere measures were also computed. The primary study intervention involved the provision to study participants of targeted instruction and practice on use of MHV's TH function's Journals and its Vitals + Readings. Seven interactive multimedia instructional modules were developed by the study team specifically for this pilot study. These modules demonstrated how to enter PA and diet information into the Journals feature of MHV's TH function; how to add weight data into the Vitals + Readings feature of the TH function and view these and other measures in tabular and graphical formats over different time frames; the concept of possible cause-effect links between behavioral lifestyle and physiological outcome (e.g., weight) data; and how to use MHV's Secure Messaging (SM) function to communicate with study team members. Participants were asked to enter food intake information at least four times per week, PA information at least three times per week, and weight recordings at least once a week over the three-month study period. An identical weight scale was provided to all participants. Findings: Statistically significant differences between post-intervention (3-month) and baseline measures were found in the direction of lower weight and reduced abdominal circumference, increased PA, and lower systolic and diastolic blood pressure. The percentage of participants that met the 3-month PA (> 100 kcal increase/day over 7 days), dietary intake (reduction in kcal/day > 100 kcal), weight (> 6 lbs. weight loss), abdominal circumference (reduction > 1 inch), and BMI (reduction > 1) criteria established for the study were, respectively, 44.7%, 44.7%, 26.3%, 52.6%, and 36.8%. Significant positive correlations were found between objective numeracy and abdominal circumference, graph literacy and abdominal circumference, and graph literacy and weight loss. Ratings based on the System Usability Scale indicated a mean score that places its usability above products such as MS Word and the Wii, and just below the iPhone. Participants' reactions regarding their satisfaction with the study were generally positive. For example, 89.2% either agreed or strongly agreed that the training on the TH function of MHV was easy to understand, and 97.3% either agreed or strongly agreed that they were satisfied with participating in this study. Impact: We believe that the customized multimedia instructional program, which not only introduced participants to the TH function of MHV but also provided insights into how to best use it and understand possible cause-effect relationships related to its use, played a critical role among the participants who demonstrated engagement with MHV and positive outcomes in lifestyle behaviors. Between 24% and 45% of the participants met positive lifestyle change (e.g., reduction in weight) criteria, which when generalized to the larger population of veterans, could have potentially important implications for disease prevention and self-health management. The intervention also provided insights into changes to MHV (e.g., in the form of training modules embedded within this PHR), which could further enhance the potential usefulness of this PHR as a self-health management tool, including the provision of aids that could help users lower in health numeracy and graph literacy skills to be able to better understand and act on the data that populates PHRs such as MHV. Indications of this need derive from findings demonstrating significant correlations between graph literacy and weight loss; we have found graph literacy to a particularly powerful predictor of successful health-management task performance using MHV in a prior study involving the usability of MHV among veterans. In particular, given the dependence of electronic tools such as PHRs on quantitative displays of tabular and graphical health-related information, it is essential that future designs of MHV provide for ways in which users lower in health numeracy and graph literacy skills can derive the benefits that such PHRs can potentially provide. Such research can then serve as a model for the general population with respect to guiding designs of future PHRs.",1,1,,,,,,,patient use of ehr/portal data,1
20153341,Safety and effectiveness of metformin therapy in patients with type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease,"This is an application for a K08 Career Development Award for Carlos Alvarez, an assistant professor and clinical pharmacist at Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center School of Pharmacy. His long-term career goal is to be an internationally known expert and independent investigator in the pharmacoepidemiology of therapeutic agents used in patients with type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease. The career development aims of this K08 application are to support training in (aim 1) pharmacoepidemiology; (aim 2) health services research; and (aim 3) analysis of large, complex national databases. This career development award will also support Dr. Alvarez's path to independence. To achieve this goal, Dr. Alvarez has assembled a multidisciplinary mentoring and advisory team with significant experience in extramurally funded clinical research. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a common and well-known complication of type 2 diabetes (T2DM). This complication often restricts providers from prescribing metformin, a glucose-lowering agent with known morbidity and mortality benefits in patients with T2DM. This FDA-labeled contraindication for metformin using arbitrary serum creatinine cut-points in patients with T2DM and CKD is not evidence-based and often necessitates prescribers to initiate or switch patients to other glucose-lowering agents with worse adverse event profiles or that have been associated with poor cardiac outcomes. Guidance in other countries does not endorse the FDA contraindication and allows for metformin use in patients with mild to moderate CKD as measured by estimated glomerular filtration rate. This recommendation is also not based in evidence. Thus, the safety and effectiveness of metformin in patients with T2DM and CKD is largely unknown. Dr. Alvarez's research will focus on determining the safety and effectiveness through three specific research aims. In aim 1 he will determine patterns of metformin use in patients with T2DM and CKD. He will analyze complex administrative and clinical data from the national VA database hosted by VINCI. Patterns identified in aim 1 will inform him of the variables that should be further tested in aims 2 and 3. Aim 2 will examine associations of adverse events for metformin and other glucose-lowering agents. Specifically, he will study incident hospitalizations for lactic acidosis and primary hospitalizations or emergency department visits for hypoglycemia. In aim 3, Dr. Alvarez will assess the relationship between metformin and the development of microvascular and macrovascular outcomes. Microvascular outcomes assessed will be the development of proliferative diabetic retinopathy and progression of kidney disease. Macrovascular outcomes will be measured as a composite of non-fatal stroke, acute myocardial infarction, non-traumatic lower extremity amputation and cardiovascular disease death. He will also compare glycemic control between patients prescribed metformin and those on other glucose-lowering agents. Innovative techniques such as combination high-dimensional propensity score and instrumental variable modeling will be used in aims 2 and 3 to reduce bias often encountered in observational research. The research will form the basis for an R01 or equivalent application to compare metformin usage patterns, safety, and effectiveness in patients with type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease between those treated in the VA system and the United Kingdom.",1,1,,,,,,,metformin among chronic kidney disease patients,1
20153543,Improving medication adherence among underserved patients with type 2 diabetes,"Approximately 1 in 3 persons with diabetes is nonadherent to their medications. Nonadherence is more common among low-income racial/ethnic minorities with type 2 diabetes (T2DM), and is a strong, independent predictor of poor glycemic control, hospitalizations, mortality, and higher health care costs. Theory-based adherence promotion interventions are more effective than atheoretical, ad hoc approaches, and are needed for patients at highest risk of nonadherence. A well-validated theoretical model, the information-motivation-behavioral skills (IMB) model, has informed effective medication adherence promotion interventions for patients with HIV and hypertension, and should inform adherence interventions in diabetes. Moreover, widely available technologies, such as mobile phones, offer a means to deliver adherence interventions to a broad range of patients, including low-income racial/ethnic minorities at high risk of nonadherence. The goal of this research is to use the IMB model to inform the content and functionality of a mobile phone-delivered medication adherence promotion intervention, ensure intervention content is clearly communicated (i.e., uses simplified text and plain language), and evaluate intervention effects on adherence and glycemic control among low-income adults with T2DM receiving primary care at federally qualified health centers (FQHCs). The specific aims and research strategy include (1) improving the content and functionality of an existing mobile phone-delivered medication adherence promotion to be consistent with the IMB model and clear health communication strategies, and testing for usability and acceptability with 36 patients before evaluating the intervention's effect on outcomes; (2) performing a randomized controlled trial with 500 patients at two FQHCs to test the effect of the intervention on subjective and objective measures of medication adherence, other self-care behaviors and glycemic control at 3, 6, 12, and 15 months, and to test whether the IMB mechanisms mediate intervention effects on adherence, test whether adherence mediates intervention effects on glycemic control, and test whether health literacy, numeracy, depression, and/or insulin status moderate intervention effects; and (3) developing recommendations for implementing and evaluating mobile phone-delivered interventions for low-income patients by conducting focus groups with intervention patients and clinic staff to identify the contextual influences on acceptance and effectiveness of the intervention. This interdisciplinary research will greatly enhance our understanding of how to address social-cognitive barriers to adherence among high-risk patients with diabetes, how to leverage mobile devices to support high-risk patient populations in general; and how to better design interventions to improve services for low-income racially/ethnically diverse patients, as well as other high-risk groups. Knowledge gained form this work may also inform interventions to reduce disparities in adherence, glycemic control, and other diabetes outcomes.",1,1,,,,,,,phone-delivered medication adherence promotion,1
20151045,Latinos understanding the need for adherence in diabetes,"Diabetes incurs the most expensive annual chronic disease-related health care costs and certain ethnic groups, such as Latinos, are disproportionately affected by the burden of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Patients with T2DM also have comorbid chronic conditions that create complexities for proper management, and have implications for future research on integrating primary and behavioral care, particularly in disadvantaged groups. Cost-effective, sustainable, and patient-centered adaptations of evidence-based approaches to chronic disease management are needed to meet the needs of the most vulnerable, low-resource communities. Integrated Health Care is the care that results from a practice team of primary care and behavioral health clinicians working together with patients and using a systematic and cost-effective approach to provide patient-centered care for a defined population. This care may address mental health conditions, health behaviors, life stressors and crises, and clinical outcomes. Care integration is a cornerstone of effective integrated health care that leads to improved clinical and quality of life outcomes and reduces health-care costs and hospitalizations, especially in vulnerable populations. The goal of this project is to improve integrated care services at a federally-qualified Community Health Center (CHC). Latinos Understanding the Need for Adherence in Diabetes (LUNA-D), is a randomized controlled trial that will test the effectiveness of an integrated behavioral health and primary care chronic care disease management intervention for low income T2DM Latino patients with 2 or more chronic conditions accessing care within San Ysidro Health Center (SYHC). The study aims are to 1) improve glycemic control, 2) improve cardiovascular risk profiles, 3) decrease psychological distress, and 4) evaluate the patient and provider acceptability and sustainability of the program. LUNA-D will recruit 414 non-insulin using adult T2DM patients with 2 or more chronic diseases. Half will be randomized to the Special Intervention (SI) and half to Usual Care (UC). The SI is a 3-month intensive intervention including fully integrated clinical visits with a mid-level provider (MLP) co-located with a behavioral health counselor (BHC) and peer-led evidence-based group health education sessions and proactive care coordination. Following the intense intervention period, the SI will receive booster sessions and fully integrated MLP/BHC clinical visits across 9 additional months. Usual Care is represented by passive appointments with the primary care physician and passive referrals to behavioral health and traditional health education. HbA1C measurements will be taken at baseline, and 3, 6, 9, and 12 months to detect changes in glycemic control. Clinical lab measures, medication adherence, weight, health behaviors and psychosocial measures will also be obtained across the study.

20151223,"Treatment of displaced, low-income children with chronic conditions","Over 1.5 million people evacuated the U.S. Gulf Coast following Hurricane Katrina (Groen and Polivka, 2007) and over 250,000 were estimated to have continued to reside in Texas nearly one year later (Texas HHS, 2006). Not only were these evacuees exposed to physical and emotional trauma, but many were from vulnerable populations and of low socio-economic status that further worsened their condition. Roughly 80% of all individuals displaced to Texas following Katrina were African American, while 60% came from households whose income was less than $20,000 per year (Texas HHSC, 2006). Children were especially vulnerable, with many missing health provider visits (Rath et al., 2007) and reporting a new onset of mental health symptoms following Katrina (Roberts, 2010). This goal of this proposal is to analyze the diagnoses and treatment of selected chronic conditions for Displaced Louisiana Children (DLCs) from low socio-economic backgrounds following Hurricane Katrina. The analysis will employ individual-level administrative data to examine the health care utilization of the roughly 30,000 DLCs enrolled in TexKat, the temporary emergency Medicaid waiver program for Katrina evacuees in Texas. The use of these data represents a potential improvement over the vast majority of existing post-disaster studies which typically employ survey data. The investigation will focus on healthcare for three chronic conditions: asthma, mental health, and diabetes. The analysis will focus on encounter rates in outpatient, emergency department, and inpatient settings as well as prescription rates for treatment medications. A difference-in-differences estimation strategy will be employed to identify changes due to displacement. Changes in utilization by DLCs before and after displacement will be compared to changes in utilization by non-displaced children. The analysis is expected to indicate that displacement was very disruptive to DLCs with chronic conditions (Rath et al., 2007). The project will provide critical information to federal, state and local agencies planning care for low-income children following disasters. The analyses of diagnoses and health care use both immediately following displacement and in the following months will provide insight into the health care needs for conditions known to be exacerbated by discontinuous medical care. By determining the services obtained by these children, our findings will assist evacuation destinations to more efficiently prepare for an influx of evacuees. Finally, policymakers may be able to use our findings to improve future Medicaid emergency waivers.",1,,,,,1,,,TexKat - medicaid waiver for katrina evacuees,1
20152619,Interactive tele-pharmacy to improve chronic medication adherence,"Nearly half of patients become nonadherent to their prescribed therapies within a year of treatment initiation. Unfortunately, the success of existing interventions to address this problem has been relatively limited, either because of the nature of the intervention or their broad applications to patients who do not require them or will not benefit from them. The efficacy of future efforts is likely to be increased by targeting interventions to nonadherent patients with poor or worsening control of their chronic conditions and tailoring interventions to individual patients based upon their willingness and ability to improve their adherence. Because the most effective interventions appear to be those that are multifaceted and thus often complex, there is also a need for multimodal interventions that are simple and which can be integrated into routine practice. The validation of adherence measures that are not based upon administrative claims data, but which can be derived from self-reported adherence or rapidly available and routinely collected pharmacy transaction records, is also a priority. To this end, we propose a cluster randomized controlled trial (RCT) of a novel tele-pharmacist-based intervention to improve adherence to medications for hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, and diabetes. This application builds on many years of research by our group on improving medication use and evaluating novel interventions in existing real-world delivery systems. The intervention will integrate the use of the electronic health record (EHR) and pharmacy claims data to identify approximately 3,000 adult patients cared for by approximately 150 primary care physicians who are both nonadherent and not achieving recommended clinical targets for glycemic, blood pressure, and cholesterol control in a real-world primary care setting. Following EHR-facilitated referral from the treating primary care physicians, a clinical pharmacist will direct an outreach program using multiple communication technologies including text messaging, secure email, mail, and ""video visits"" with the intensity of the intervention tailored to the patient's level of ""activation."" The aims of the study are to (1) implement and evaluate the ability of a novel tele-pharmacist intervention in a multispecialty group practice to improve adherence and clinically relevant outcomes, (2) assess the cost-effectiveness of the intervention, and (3) validate the ability to use retail pharmacy filling data and self-reported data to evaluate adherence. Using a rigorous randomized design, we have proposed a feasible and sustainable intervention that links adherence to clinically relevant outcome measures as a core component of the program. As the nation considers substantial investments in health information technology and primary care-based population management, our intervention will provide important insights into how to effectively improve medication adherence and, ultimately, chronic care outcomes.",1,,1,1,,,,,"auto-EHR referral, tele-pharmacist intervention",1
20161255,Genomic diagnosis and individualized therapy of highly penetrant genetic diabetes,"Diabetes mellitus affects over 25 million individuals in the United States and is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality. At least 1% of diabetes (>250,000 individuals) results from high penetrant single gene defects, in HNF1A, GCK, and HNF4A and several other genes. Unfortunately, as a result of phenotypic overlap with more common forms of diabetes, lack of awareness and/or techniques for identifying them among health care providers, and the cost and labor historically involved in sequencing several genes as required to make a diagnosis, the vast majority of cases of highly penetrant and genetic diabetes are misdiagnosed as type 1 (T1DM) or type 2 diabetes (T2DM). Published evidence shows that diagnosing highly penetrant genetic forms of diabetes enables personalized treatment resulting in improved glucose control, better prediction of prognosis, and an enhanced familial risk assessment. To meet this need, we propose to implement and evaluate in four diverse health care settings our Personalized Diabetes Medicine Program (PDMP). The PDMP is currently based at the University of Maryland Center for Diabetes and Endocrinology and will be disseminated to UM Family Medicine and three partner centers: the Baltimore Veterans Administration Medical Center (BVAMC, with opportunities to disseminate nationally), Geisinger Medical Center (an integrated health system), and Bay West Endocrinology Associates (a community-based private practice group). We will also engage the community through advertisements and site visits to local primary care practices by our genetic counselor/diabetes educator team. The PDMP consists of a simple patient screening questionnaire, chart/electronic health record (EHR) review, an algorithm that utilizes questionnaire data, routine lab testing, and family history review to identify patients most likely to have highly penetrant genetic diabetes; customized multiplex gene panel sequencing of eligible patients followed by confirmation of diabetes-causal mutations in our CLIA-approved Translational Genomics Laboratory; incorporation of mutations and decision support in the EHR; genetic counseling; implementing a mutation-based treatment strategy; and family screening. Deliverables include EHR-based implementation tools, the sequencing panel and contribution of genotype/phenotype data regarding diabetes-causal variants and variants of unknown clinical significance to ClinVar and other similar public resources. We will track implementation metrics of the PDMP and conduct an impact evaluation, including evaluation of clinical outcomes as measured by changes in glycemic control in patients diagnosed with a genetic form of diabetes. Finally, we will engage a Payer Advisory Panel in the development of the impact evaluation process to enhance our ability to collect meaningful evidence to inform clinical practice recommendations and guide insurance coverage decisions as a first step to enabling diagnosis of inherited forms of diabetes across the United States and, more broadly, genomic diagnosis and treatment of highly penetrant genetic forms of other common diseases.",1,1,1,,,,,,"EHR algorithm use, family screening, and individual questionnaire for high penetrant single gene effects",1
20143324,Jump starting shared medical appointments for diabetes with weight management,"Background: SMAs involve groups of patients who share a common chronic condition and meet over time to receive education, self-management enhancement, and medication management to improve clinical outcomes. A systematic review by VA found that SMAs modestly improve glycemia in patients with diabetes. Although these SMA programs sometimes included diet and physical activity counseling, weight management was not a primary goal, and weight typically was not reduced. Instead, medication intensification was the primary strategy for improving glycemia, and this strategy can lead to weight gain. For overweight patients with diabetes, weight loss is first-line therapy because it can improve glycemic control and because excess weight leads to poorer outcomes. Moreover, many antiglycemic medications cause weight gain and hypoglycemic events, which may counteract the potential macrovascular benefits of glycemic control. Dietary interventions, however, can lower weight and improve glycemic control while reducing antiglycemic medication needs and, therefore, subsequent risk for hypoglycemic episodes. In our prior research, we induced weight loss and improved glycemic control while decreasing antiglycemic medications. A combination of an intensive weight management program with the diabetes management offered in SMAs has potential to further improve diabetes outcomes, reduce complications, decrease costs, and increase health-related quality of life. Such a combined intervention is ideal for patients with diabetes because of their unique dietary considerations, and their need for careful glycemic and medication management during weight loss. Objectives: We will examine whether an intensive, group-based weight management program followed by an SMA intervention (WM/SMA arm) is comparably effective (non-inferior) to the SMA intervention alone for improving glycemic control while using less antiglycemic medication and resulting in fewer hypoglycemic events and lower health care costs. Methods: A total of 263 overweight VA outpatients with uncontrolled (hemoglobin A1c > = 8.0%) type 2 diabetes participated in this RCT. Similar to prior SMAs, the SMA visits occurred every 4 weeks for 16 weeks and then every 8 weeks for 32 weeks for a total of 9 visits. Sessions were led by a physician and trained interventionists, and included educational topics related to diabetes management (including diet and physical activity), self-management training, and medication adjustment. Similar to our prior weight management trials, the WM/SMA group met every 2 weeks for 16 weeks and then every 8 weeks for 32 weeks, for a total of 13 visits. The weight management program focused on a low carbohydrate dietary pattern because of its potential to lower glycemia, leading to reduced antiglycemic medication needs. After 16 weeks, meeting content shifted to the SMA intervention content but weight management continued to be addressed at the meetings. The primary outcome was glycemic control assessed by hemoglobin A1c measured at baseline and at 16, 32, and 48 weeks. Secondary outcomes included hypoglycemic events, changes in the antiglycemic medication regimen as assessed by a summary score, and weight and health care costs. Diabetes-specific health-related quality of life and medication adherence were also examined. Findings: Initial findings were that both the WM/SMA and SMA interventions improved participants' HbA1c. The WM/SMA intervention had a greater initial improvement in HbA1c at weeks 16 and 32 but was not significantly different from SMA at the final outcome visit at week 48. Diabetes quality of life improved more in the WM/WMA intervention initially but was not significantly different than SMA at the final outcome visit. WM/SMA participants had lower diabetes medication utilization (using a medication effect score) and greater weight loss than SMA participants at week 16 that was maintained at week 48. Limitations of the study are that WM/SMA intervention had more frequent visits in the first 16 weeks compared to SMA intervention, study physicians who performed medication adjustments were not blinded to treatment arm, and the medication effect score presumes a linear relationship between dosage and HbA1c. Impact: We tested a novel intervention that combined intensive weight and diabetes management using the SMA platform. This research addresses an important mission to VA because diabetes is more prevalent in veterans than in the general population, and because weight management is more challenging and complex in patients with diabetes. This study has the potential to enhance diabetes management strategies and benefit veterans with diabetes by delivering effective disease and weight management in a novel, economical, and efficient clinical system design. The study demonstrated that shared medical appointments incorporating intensive weight management led to substantial initial improvements in important diabetes outcomes. Maintaining intensity of WM/SMA intervention over time may increase durability of outcomes.",1,,1,,,,,,group based weight management program,1
20143397,A patient-centered strategy for improving diabetes prevention in urban American Indians,"Background: Type 2 diabetes affects over 25 million adults in the US. Low socioeconomic status and racial/ethnic minority populations, such as urban American Indian and Alaska Native peoples (AIAN), are disproportionately represented among Americans with diabetes and those at risk for diabetes. The prevalence of diabetes is more than twice as high among AIANs compared to whites (18% vs. 8%). The landmark Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) demonstrated that lifestyle interventions are more effective for reducing the incidence of diabetes compared to medication and placebo. However, there is a lack of evidence on the effectiveness of primary care-based translations of the DPP targeting patient-centered outcomes among minority populations who are at high risk of diabetes. Significant and prevalent psychosocial issues, such as stress, grief, and mental health conditions, among minority groups like urban AIAN may facilitate the progression from obesity to diabetes and hinder successful implementation of evidence-based lifestyle interventions. Effective patient-centered strategies to prevent diabetes among urban AIANs are urgently needed to eliminate health disparities in the US. Strategies developed for urban AIANs can be readily tailored for other low-income and racial/ethnic minority populations. Objectives: We aim to (1) engage patient and provider stakeholders to better understand the patient-centered perspective on psychosocial issues that influence progression to diabetes among urban AIANs; 2) strengthen, refine, and test an enhanced DPP that incorporates psychosocial support for urban AIANs in a randomized controlled trial; and 3) disseminate research findings to key stakeholders at the local, state, and national level. Methods: An ongoing strong collaboration between Stanford University Program on Prevention Outcomes and Practices and the Indian Health Center of Santa Clara Valley will guide all phases of the research project. The local American Indian Community Action Board will provide sincere patient involvement in all phases of the proposed research. We hypothesize that addressing psychosocial barriers within a culturally tailored DPP will result in superior patient-centered and clinical outcomes as compared to a standard DPP. We will test an enhanced DPP that addresses psychosocial barriers, comparing it to the standard DPP using a randomized clinical trial design (n=204). Obese (body mass index>30) self-identified urban AIANs with one or more non-weight related component of the metabolic syndrome will be randomized to the standard or enhanced DPP. Dual primary outcomes will include BMI (clinical) and quality of life (patient-oriented). Patient outcomes (projected): Diabetes and its prevention are of critical importance to the American Indian community. This project will provide evidence to urban AIANs and their providers on programs to interrupt the dysmetabolism pathway according to outcomes important to patients and providers.",1,1,1,,,,,,psychosocial influences on diabetes among AIAN,1
20152638,"Randomized controlled trial (RCT) on comanagement of obesity, depression, and elevated cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk in primary care","Patients with coexisting obesity and depression and common cardiometabolic risk factors are a critical target group for primary prevention because of their increasing prevalence and increased, but potentially reversible, lifetime risk for diabetes mellitus (DM) and cardiovascular disease. But little is known about how to treat them in concert in ways that are evidence-based and practical in primary care settings. The proposed study will test, for the first time, a clinical intervention that uniquely integrates the Group Lifestyle Balance (GLB) program for weight loss, which is a ""real-world"" translated model of the Diabetes Prevention Program lifestyle intervention, with the PEARLS collaborative stepped-care program for depression, which uses problem-solving therapy (PST) as first-line with as-needed intensification through stepwise increases in doses and number of antidepressant medications. Obese, depressed adults with coexisting metabolic syndrome, pre-DM, and/or history of gestational DM will be the target patient population. Eligible and consenting primary care patients (n=404) from a large, community-based, multispecialty group practice will be randomized to receive the combined treatment or usual care for 12 months. Trained health coaches, working under co-located psychiatric and medical supervision, will provide eight one-on-one PST sessions over 5 months followed by 6 monthly calls. At the fourth one-on-one session, the coach will introduce the take-home GLB DVD, which has 12 weekly sessions and is supplemented by ongoing Web-, mobile-, and email-mediated coach support for weight loss and behavior change. Following a stepped-care protocol, the supervising psychiatrist will recommend initiating or adjusting anti-depressant medications to primary providers of patients with unremitting symptoms, and if necessary, provide phone consultations to patients. Follow-up assessments will occur at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months. The primary aim is to determine the effectiveness of the intervention (""E"" in the RE-AIM model). We hypothesize (1) that compared with controls, intervention participants will have better co-primary endpoints, i.e., lower mean BMI and score on the 20-item Depression Symptom Checklist at 12 months (end of treatment); (2) that these incremental intervention benefits will persist through 24 months (end of follow-up); and (3) that the intervention will show cost-effectiveness within 2 years and over a projected longer term, based on the ratio of incremental costs (estimated from health system and societal perspectives) to incremental benefits (expressed as quality-adjusted life years gained). The secondary aim is to conduct process evaluation with mixed methods for the other RE-AIM attributes: Reach (e.g., participation rate of the target population), Adoption (e.g., characteristics of participating clinics and providers), Implementation (e.g., fidelity of intervention delivery), and Maintenance (e.g., stakeholders' perceptions of intervention sustainability). We will also explore effect modifiers and mediators to enable intervention refinement for maximum impact. The proposed integrated multicondition approach to treating obesity and depression and cardiometabolic risk factors in primary care is novel and likely scalable, with high public health impact potential.",1,,1,,,,,,group lifestyle balance  ,1
20152668,SPREAD-NET: PRactices Enabling Adapting and Disseminating in the Safety NET,"The nation's ""safety net"" community health centers (CHCs) could benefit greatly from implementing interventions shown to be effective at improving health care processes and outcomes in other settings. However, a lack of knowledge about the most effective strategies for supporting implementation of evidence-based interventions in CHCs presents a major barrier to the timely dissemination of clinical innovations. Our long-term goal is to learn how best to disseminate evidence-based interventions into CHCs nationwide. Working towards that goal, we propose to compare the effectiveness of different ""support strategies"" at helping diverse CHCs sustainably implement an intervention shown to reduce patients' cardiovascular disease (CVD) event risk. Kaiser Permanente developed and implemented the ""ALL Initiative"" (a.k.a. ""ALL""), a clinic-level intervention designed to increase rates of adult patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) or CVD who are prescribed cardio-protective medications (statins and ACE inhibitors) according to evidence-based guidelines. After ALL was shown to be highly effective in Kaiser Permanente's integrated care setting, our team demonstrated the feasibility of adapting it for successful implementation in 11 CHCs, with the help of substantial implementation support. The next step in this body of research is to identify the amount and type of support needed to effectively implement and sustain this intervention in a greater number of CHCs. To that end, we will conduct a trial in which 30 CHCs are cluster-randomized to receive low-, medium-, or high-intensity support in implementing ALL. We will conduct this work with CHC members of OCHIN, a community health information technology network that hosts one of the nation's largest CHC electronic health record (EHR) platforms; study CHCs share a single, linked EHR. Guided by the Practice Change Model and RE-AIM framework, we will use mixed methods to (aim 1) compare how effectively the low-, medium-, and high-intensity strategies support the CHCs' implementation of ALL, and assess change in rates of clinic patients with (i) guideline-appropriate cardioprotective prescriptions, and (ii) controlled blood pressure and low-density lipoprotein, as associated with implementation supported by the different strategies; (aim 2) assess the strategies' effectiveness at supporting intervention sustainability over three years; and (aim 3) identify clinic characteristics associated with success at different levels of support. Our team includes CHC clinicians, and experts in dissemination and implementation (D&I), health economics, and health services research mixed methods. Our study is designed to inform future implementation of ALL as well as other interventions known to improve outcomes among CHC patients with DM /CVD. Our results could also have high impact on dissemination and implementation (D&I) science, by comparing practical, generalizable methods for supporting the implementation of clinical innovations in CHCs and other ambulatory settings.",1,,,1,,,,,evaluation of implementation strategies,1
20152788,Developing customized primary care to improve mental health in multimorbidity,"Mental health outcomes among depressed or anxious primary care patients with multimorbidity (two or more chronic medical problems) have been compromised by poor communication about patients' preoccupations with finances, safety, mobility, and other everyday concerns related to chronic disease. Patients are not empowered to articulate these concerns and time constraints make it difficult for primary care physicians (PCPs) to elicit them. Capitalizing on recent developments in decision technology and conjoint analysis, we propose to test the feasibility and impact of a novel intervention that has two components: a computer-based discussion prioritization tool (DPT) and a customized question prompt list (QPL). The DPT helps patients identify their most pressing concerns. The QPL will be generated after patients use the DPT, and consists of tailored question prompts designed to help patients express their concerns. This proposed project will be implemented in two phases. Phase 1 will establish the usability of the DPT and QPL and the feasibility of having patients and PCPs use the DPT and QPL in a primary care setting. In phase 2, participants (e40 years of age) with a diagnosis of two or more chronic medical conditions (type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, and osteoarthritis) who screen positive for either depression or anxiety will be recruited from two primary care clinics and randomized to customized care vs. an active control. We expect that the intervention will improve patient-PCP communication, improve the therapeutic alliance between the patient and the PCP, and improve mental health outcomes. This work will lay the groundwork for a larger randomized controlled trial to test the effects of the customized care intervention with repeated exposures over time.",1,,,1,,,,,clinic based tool to evaluate patient concerns and preferencs,1
20153433,Mentoring in the context of improving care for Latinos with diabetes,"The exponential growth of the U.S. born and immigrant Latino population over the last two decades in the United States, coupled with the national increase in obesity, has led to an enormous increase in the number of Latino patients with diabetes. Effective care of these patients is often complicated by language barriers, low health literacy, and low patient engagement which all contribute to well-documented disparities in diabetes outcomes. This proposal outlines a five-year career development plan for the candidate to expand her mentoring work with early career researchers focused on clinical and health services research dedicated to improving diabetes outcomes among low-income Latino patients. In addition to mentoring plans, the proposal outlines three specific aims to a) identify patient perceptions of barriers and facilitators to accessing language assistance services in diabetes care, b) explore barriers and facilitators to the establishment of healthy infant feeding habits among low-income Latina women with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) in the context of an automated telephone self-management intervention, and c) develop and formatively evaluate a social marketing campaign aimed at encouraging Latino parents with diabetes to decrease sugar-sweetened beverage consumption in their children aged 3-11. Through the efficient leveraging of existing resources, collaborations, data, and affiliations with NIH-funded networks, the overarching goal of this application is to promote the effective mentorship of early career investigators at all levels of the research training pipeline in Latino diabetes clinical and translational research.",1,,,,1,,,,social marketing to decrease SSB consumption,1
20153498,Measuring multimorbidity with individualized disease-specific quality of life (QOL) impact scales,"It is well documented that multimorbidity, or multiple chronic conditions (MCC), impairs patients' functioning and health-related quality of life (QOL). However, our ability to study the impact of and account for multimorbidity is hampered by methodological problems underlying its conceptualization and measurement. These include lack of a uniform definition, proliferation of diverse multimorbidity indexes, widespread reliance on indexes using population weights that were not developed to explain variations in patients' QOL, and a paucity of indexes that take individual assessments of disease burden into account. The goal of this project is to improve the assessment of MCC impact for the purposes of analyzing and interpreting generic patient-reported outcome (PRO) measures of QOL. We will conduct secondary analyses of cross-sectional and longitudinal data collected in 2011 and 2012 for 10,624 adults from two independent samples (one sampled to represent the U.S. general population and a second cohort oversampled from adults pre-identified with arthritis, cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease, diabetes, or respiratory disease), pursuant to the NIA-sponsored Computerized Adaptive Assessment of Disease Impact (DICAT) grant (R44 AG025589, Ware, PI). For 36 conditions, DICAT developed standardized disease-specific scales measuring the QOL impact attributed to each condition. These condition-specific QOL impact scores have been evaluated on a disease-by-disease basis but have not been evaluated collectively to determine how well they measure multimorbidity and its impact. We propose to extend this work to better understand the ability of patients to make valid QOL attributions to individual conditions in the context of MCC. We will also determine the importance of differences in alternative approaches to aggregating condition-specific patient QOL impact ratings in the presence of MCC, specifically for purposes of analyzing and interpreting generic PROs. The project has the following specific aims: (1) explore the extent to which patients with MCC can make valid attributions to specific conditions when reporting disease impact on QOL, (2) systematically evaluate different MCC aggregation methods used to predict generic PRO outcomes, and (3) cross-validate methods and results with independent data. Additional research will likely be required to fully implement the methodological advances proven to be useful in this research. However, the approach to conceptualizing and measuring MCC impact evaluated in this project ultimately may enable the use of standardized PRO-based MCC impact measures to better estimate and interpret differences in patient case-mix and PRO outcomes in comparative effectiveness research.",1,,,,,,1,,improve identification of multimobidity,1
20143062,Informing consumer health IT design: how patients use social networking sites,"The broad, long-term objective of this work is to improve the quality of health care by creating consumer health IT that is aligned with the needs and preferences of diverse patient subpopulations. Many forms of consumer health IT are being developed to support patients in the tasks of health management as health care moves from institutional to home- and community-based settings. However, the design of health IT is rarely grounded in an in-depth assessment of users' needs and preferences, resulting in solutions that are not responsive to the ways in which patients approach health management. The objective of this study, therefore, is to develop patient-centered design guidance for consumer health IT that supports one health management task: health information communication with members of patients' social networks (e.g., family members, friends, online acquaintances) based on an understanding of patients' existing use of a popular online social networking site, Facebook, for health communication. This objective will be accomplished through two specific aims: 1) to generate general design guidance for consumer health IT based on an explication of the ways in which type 2 diabetes patients engaged with Facebook leverage this technology to support health information communication with members of the social network; and 2) to generate design guidance for unique segments of the user population based on an understanding of how type 2 diabetes patients engaged with Facebook cluster into different patterns or styles of health information communication with members of the social network. This mixed-methods study will be grounded in macroergonomic theory and will consist of three phases. In phase one, qualitative methods will be used to gain a rich understanding of the ways in which patients use Facebook for health information communication with members of the social network. In phase two, the findings from this qualitative exploration will be used to create and pilot a structured questionnaire. In phase three, a large-scale survey of type 2 diabetes patients engaged with Facebook will be used to assess the overall prevalence of specific health information communication practices through descriptive statistics and to define particular segments of the patient population based upon these practices through cluster analysis. The qualitative and quantitative components of the study will be synthesized and translated into general and segment-specific design guidance for consumer health IT. Throughout all study phases, the purposeful sampling strategies employed will help ensure that the study population is inclusive of both genders and the five racial and two ethnic groups of primary interest to AHRQ. Thus, the proposed study will accelerate the development of health IT that effectively supports patient-centered care across diverse patient subgroups. This work will serve as a foundation for our future research efforts, which will 1) assess the feasibility and value of integrating this form of design guidance into the design process; and 2) assess the impact of consumer health IT grounded in this design guidance on outcomes such as use, usefulness, usability, satisfaction, and, ultimately, health outcomes.",1,,1,,,,,,how health IT can be shared with social networks,1
20143203,Are diabetes risk and preventive behaviors shared in households?,"Diabetes is a complex, multi-factorial condition, affecting 26 million people in the United States and an additional 79 million people are at high risk of developing diabetes. However, 90% of people at high risk of diabetes don't know about their risk and very few are given guidance by their health care providers about improving their diets, engaging in physical activity, and lowering weight to reduce their risk of getting diabetes. We also know very little about how much these behavior choices are influenced by one's social connections, particularly partners or spouses that live in the same household, share resources, and have the same values and access to similar information. For example, emergence of diseases like cancers or diabetes can heighten family members' concerns of also developing disease, and stimulate them to engage in preventive behaviors. We aim to investigate these social ""spillover"" effects on preventive behaviors and diabetes risk within households by analyzing longitudinal data from 2005 to 2014 from a large, diverse insured population. Kaiser Permanente Northern California has a longitudinal and multi-ethnic database of 3.3 million members and offers a rich opportunity to link biometric, laboratory, and health service utilization data for primary plan members and their linked dependents. We will study whether a new diabetes diagnosis in the household prompts partners or spouses to change their lifestyle behaviors; whether this adoption of preventive behaviors is different across demographic or socioeconomic groups; and whether these behaviors are maintained 3-6 years after the diagnosis. We will also study whether adult family members that are on the same health insurance plan and live in the same household of someone that was newly diagnosed with diabetes in this time have a high risk of getting diabetes themselves. And lastly, we will study whether the lifestyle behavior changes adopted are associated with reduced risk of diabetes in the family member. The findings from this study may lead to new ways of identifying people at high risk of diabetes--for example, doctors notifying people with new diabetes diagnoses to encourage their household members to get checked too. In addition, it may also lead to new studies to help whole families change and maintain their lifestyle behaviors together. Our proposal aims to use a unique and underutilized set of databases to answer these topical and innovative questions. Utilizing the combined and interdisciplinary expertise of our Emory University and KPNC study team, we will use advanced statistical and quasi-experimental methods to analyze the data, controlling for measurable biases and using sensitivity analyses to explore factors that cannot be accounted for. This study is novel in concept, efficient in design, and findings will have important implications for screening recommendations, for advising people with a new diagnosis of diabetes, and for exploring avenues to stimulate sustainable healthful behaviors through families.",1,,1,,,,,,social spillover effects,1
20143286,Personal health record-facilitated diabetes self-management among rural veterans,"Background: Veterans bear a disproportionate burden of diagnosed diabetes at a 24% prevalence compared to 8.3% nationally. Patient-level factors account for >95% of patient care and health management. Poor patient knowledge/information and participation are two key factors responsible for the most prevalent disparities in the VA health care system for which patient activation and adherence interventions may help to reduce disparities in care, but patients have a low rate of engagement in self-care behaviors. Health care systems have established personal health records (PHRs), such as My HealtheVet (MHV), that enable patients to access their own health records, obtain health information, and communicate with providers about their disease conditions. This study proposes to activate patients and improve patient diabetes-related behaviors through development of an adapted brief MHV-driven patient activation and self-care intervention that enhances diabetes self-management (DSM) skills (e.g., physical activity, diet, medication adherence, and self-monitoring) in high-risk, rural veterans. Objectives: The objectives of this study are to a) adapt a brief My HealtheVet (MHV) intervention to enhance its appropriateness for veterans with diabetes and increase patient activation and DSM skills; b) test feasibility and preliminary effectiveness of the adapted brief MHV intervention on DSM skills in rural veterans; and c) evaluate veterans' experience with the adapted brief MHV intervention and identify perceived barriers, facilitators, and enablers of its use, and assess the potential for wider dissemination. Methods: To achieve these objectives, we will develop an adapted brief MHV intervention that targets DSM skills. Training for features of My HealtheVet (setting goals, entering/tracking data, researching health-related information, secure messaging) will first be developed. We will obtain a nonrandomized sample of at least 20 rural veterans, age 45+ years, with diabetes and either hypertension or hyperlipidemia from community-based outpatient clinics in the Charleston VA catchment area. The intervention will involve an initial in-person session with the rest of the intervention sessions delivered remotely. In addition, weekly reminders (or booster messages) will be sent to each participant through the MHV secure messaging. All participants will undergo assessments at baseline and at 6 weeks follow-up. For those who agree, semi-structured telephone interviews will be conducted with study participants to evaluate veterans' experience with learning and navigating MHV through the intervention and to assess feasibility, ease of use, and refinement for potential dissemination to a broader audience. The primary outcome (frequency of and satisfaction with MHV use) and secondary outcomes (change in DSM skills and clinical indicators) will be assessed in all participants at 6 weeks follow-up. The primary analysis will involve mixed-effects models. Findings: N/A. Impact: The proposed project offers a potential solution to strengthening veterans' self-management of chronic disease conditions through intervention of an easily accessible self-management tool, the VA's PHR--My HealtheVet--that fosters the knowledge and skill-building aspects of diabetes self-management. The proposed approach creates flexible and accessible strategies for increasing knowledge, developing self-monitoring skills, building self-efficacy, and enhancing patient empowerment. Thus, active orientation to the use of MHV as a skill-building tool will foster adoption of proper self-monitoring behaviors. The proposed project serves to yield a more patient-oriented process in access to and quality of care, and disease management. Furthermore, this project will provide early evidence to increase adoption and use of MHV in disadvantaged veteran groups.",1,1,,,,,,,helping veterans use EHR/patient portal more effectively,1
20143434,Using peer mentors to support patient-aligned care team (PACT) team efforts to improve diabetes control,"Background: Using peer mentors to support health-related behavior change may be particularly effective in a VA setting where many patients lack social support on the one hand, but have latent bonds because of shared or similar veteran experiences. The research team has demonstrated that peer mentoring can help African American veterans with hard-to-manage diabetes mellitus improve their glucose control in the short term; however, it is unknown if demonstrated improvements in glucose control persist once mentoring stops and how to best sustain such programs. These are essential questions to address in order to successfully build a generalizable and scalable peer mentor program. This work builds on past and ongoing work with the aim of creating evidence-based, low-cost, easy-to-implement peer-mentoring programs that can sustainably support VA PACT efforts. Objectives: The current application sought to (1) test the effectiveness of a self-sustaining peer-mentoring program that trains former peer mentees to be peer mentors to support health-related behavior change in diabetic veterans with poor diabetes control; (2) assess the effects of becoming a mentor on those who were originally mentees, given a growing literature that being a mentor is good for your health; and (3) conduct a rigorous qualitative evaluation examining in-depth the mentor-mentee relationship, the transition to becoming a mentor, and exploring factors relevant to broader program implementation. Methods: To test our hypotheses, we conducted a randomized controlled trial (clinicaltrials.gov number NCT01651117). In the first phase, poorly controlled diabetics were randomized to receive mentoring from well-controlled peers or to usual care. In the second phase, different poorly controlled diabetics were randomized to receive mentoring from peers who had been mentored in the first phase or to usual care. In addition, to assess whether becoming a mentor in phase 2 had any benefit for those who were mentored in phase 1, past mentees from phase 1 were randomized to either be a mentor in phase 2 or to usual care. Potential participants were identified through the electronic medical records (EMR). Diabetic patients were considered in poor control if they had HbA1c > 8% on at least 2 occasions in the 24 months prior to enrollment. Phase 1 potential mentors had to be in good control (with at least one HbA1c 7.5% in the 3 months prior to enrollment) but in previously poor control (at least one HbA1c > 8% in the 3 years prior to enrollment). Additional inclusion criteria included age 30 to 75, type II diabetic, access to telephone for contact with mentor/mentee, and ability to understand English. Mentor training consisted of an hour-long one-on-one training that was informed by motivational interviewing techniques. Mentors were contacted monthly to reinforce training and discuss interactions with their mentees. All participants received $50 for each in-person visit. Mentors also received $20 for each month in which they contacted or attempted to contact their mentee at least weekly. To achieve 80% power to detect a 0.8 unit change in A1c (standard error 1.6) between phase 2 mentors and non-mentors, a sample of 64 patients per arm was required. To protect against expected attrition (as seen in the pilot study), we inflated that by 10% to arrive at 72 participants per arm. Working backwards to determine how many poorly controlled diabetics would be needed in phase 1, we started with 144 (72 for each arm of phase 2) and inflated by 10% to arrive at 160, thus we intended to recruit 320 poorly controlled diabetics and randomize 1:1 to get 160 mentees and 160 usual care. After mid-study evaluation, with guidance from our Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB), it was determined that resources were being wasted on such a large usual care group, so randomization was change to 2:1. Additionally, mid-study evaluation revealed that attrition was higher than expected. As a result, we recruited additional poorly controlled diabetics to phase 1 to have sufficient phase 2 mentors. All methodological changes were documented in protocol amendments, and approved by the IRB. All randomization was done using permuted blocks with varying block size using SAS Proc Plan. The primary outcome of interest was change in A1c from baseline to 6 months. Change in A1c from baseline to 12 months was a secondary outcome. Additional secondary outcomes included change from baseline of other measurements (LDL, systolic blood pressure, diabetes distress score, and depression score) at 6 and 12 months. All participants had a baseline, 6-, and 12-month visits during which A1c, LDL, blood pressure, weight and height were measured and several surveys were administered. Our basic model for all analyses was an analysis of covariance comparing change in outcome (A1c) from baseline to 6 months, adjusting for baseline (A1c). To also assess change from baseline to 12 months, we used a mixed-effects model and included a time fixed effects and a patient random effects. We also looked at dichotomized outcomes for A1c (1% improvement) using logistic regression. Subset analyses including only those who had a baseline HbA1c > 8% (since some patients who were recruited as poorly controlled based on the EMR showed good control at baseline). Approximately 13% of participants were missing 6-month A1c. To perform intent-to-treat analysis (which included all randomized patients except those who died during the intervention period), we used multiple imputation using Markov-chain Monte Carlo methods with 25 iterations. Analyses were conducted on each iteration and results were combined using Ruben's formula. Qualitative semi-structured interviews were conducted to understand participants' experiences, their relationship with their partner, and how the intervention impacted their behavior. Purposive sampling was done to ensure adequate representation of mentees who made large strides in improving their A1c, those who made marginal improvements or got worse. All interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed and analyzed for salient themes. Findings: Aim 1: We enrolled 365 poorly controlled veterans (158 into usual care and 207 into the intervention arm), 51% of those who were contacted and eligible into phase 1. Sixty-five were African American and 96% were male. Baseline biometrics were: A1c 9.5% (SD 1.6), LDL 95.4 mm/dl (SD 35.2), and SBP 137.4 mmHg (SD 18.4). The mean change in A1c was -0.20 (95% CI -0.46, 0.06) in usual care and -0.52 (95% CI -0.76, -0.29) for the intervention arm, (p=0.06). Sixty-seven people had, on enrollment, an A1c of 8%. When we limited the analysis to the 298 people with a baseline A1c > 8%, the mean change in A1c was -0.32 (95% CI -0.60, -0.05) for usual care and -0.75 (95% CI -1.01, -0.48) for the intervention arm, (p=0.03). For the intervention arm compared to usual care, the odds of dropping A1c by 1 point was 1.70 (95% CI 1.01, -2.86: p=0.05). There was no difference in A1c between arms at 12 months. The intervention did not influence LDL control, blood pressure control, diabetes distress, or depressive symptoms. For phase 2, we enrolled 122 people to receive mentoring from a former mentee (49 to usual care, 73 to the intervention). The mean change in A1c was -0.46 (95% CI -1.02, 0.10) in usual care and -0.08 (95% CI -0.42, 0.57) for the intervention arm, (p=0.16). Including the additional 158 people who had been randomized to control in phase 1 did not change these results. However, when we compared the change in A1c between those who received mentoring from a mentor who had been successful as a mentee (dropped A1c by 1% when a mentee) to those who had not, those who received mentoring from a past successful mentee dropped their A1c by -0.28 (95% CI -0.89, 0.34) compared to those who received mentoring from a past unsuccessful mentee 0.76 (95% CI -0.05, 1.57) (p=0.05). Mentees in this phase, at 6 months, showed significantly better improvement in diabetes distress score compared to usual care patients (0.10 usual care v -0.41, p=0.02). No other outcomes showed significant differences between usual care and mentees. As with the first phase, effects did not persist at 12 months. Aim 2: Seventy former mentees were randomized to becoming a mentor and 69 were randomized to be a non-mentor. Becoming a mentor did not prove beneficial to former mentees. Both mentors and non-mentors increased their A1c at 6 months (0.14 and 0.32, respectively, p=0.54). Aim 3: The intervention was well-received, with most participants describing it as valuable. Participants perceived the intervention to have many benefits, including having accessible support, increased self-confidence, increased accountability, increased self-efficacy, improved glucose control, and fulfilling a sense of altruism. Participants did encounter barriers, including logistical, interpersonal, and individual obstacles. Mentors struggled with mentees who were dealing with mental health or medical comorbidities and mentees struggled if they perceived their control to be better than their mentors. The more successful mentees tended to be more effusive in their description of their mentors, described a stronger sense of connection to their mentor, described a more structured interaction with their mentor, and tended to be more complimentary of the intervention. Impact: Relying on the inherent strengths of the veteran community, peer mentoring shows potential as a means to improving outcomes in patients with diabetes. Overall, this peer support program was well received but might be optimized by selecting naturally inclined mentors, providing additional training to introduce more structure into mentorship interactions, choosing mentors who have obtained a level of control, and targeting mentees who are not struggling with overwhelming comorbidities.",1,,1,1,,,,,peer mentor intervention,1
20151096,External determinants of non-elderly veterans' demand of VA health care,"Background: Of the 8.4 million veterans enrolled for VHA care, 65 percent obtained some form of VA care; however, little is known about regional differences and temporal changes in the reliance on VA care, in particular, to its sensitivity to factors that are external to VA policy intervention. With a high prevalence of low-income veterans, especially among the non-elderly (age < 65 years), reliance on VA care depends heavily on a range of external factors: state public assistance (Medicaid), area-level economic indicators (unemployment and housing price index), local non-VA health care provider availability, and out-of-pocket health care costs. Objectives: Veterans' utilization of Veterans Affairs (VA) health care is likely influenced by community factors external to the VA, including Medicaid eligibility and unemployment, though such factors are rarely considered in models predicting such utilization. We measured the sensitivity of VA utilization to changes in such factors (hereafter, ""external determinants""), including the 2014 Medicaid expansion following the Affordable Care Act. Methods: We merged national VA health care enrollment and utilization data with area-level data on Medicaid policy, unemployment, employer-sponsored insurance, housing prices, and non-VA physician availability (2008-2014). For veterans aged 18-64 and =65, we estimated the sensitivity of annual individual VA health care utilization, measured by the cost ($) of care received, to changes in external determinants using longitudinal regression models controlling for individual fixed effects. Sensitivity was measured as the percentage change in annual utilization associated with a 10 percent annual increase in the value of an external determinant. We estimated sensitivity for type of service (inpatient, outpatient, pharmacy, Fee Basis) and for subgroups, including states by Medicaid expansion status. Findings: We examined 8.02 million veterans over an average of 5.2 years; 56% were aged 18-64 during the study period. Annual individual VA health care utilization ranged between $3,853 and $4,617 across years among both age groups. All external determinants exhibited sizable variation over time; Medicaid eligibility increased 33% between 2013 and 2014. All external determinants were associated with small but significant changes in VA health care utilization. For veterans aged 18-64, sensitivity was modest for all external determinants: Medicaid eligibility (-0.31% in 2014), employer-sponsored coverage (-1.40%), unemployment ratio (0.65%) housing price index (0.92%) and non-VA physician availability (1.20%). Overall, external determinants were associated with a $245 million increase in national VA spending between 2013 and 2014. Sensitivity was sizable among subgroups; in states that expanded Medicaid in 2014, this expansion was associated with 9.1% ($826 million) reduction in VA utilization among those aged 18-64; the corresponding change in non-expansion states ($18 million) was not significant. Among veterans aged =65, VA utilization was positively associated with increases in housing price index (2.24%) and non-VA provider availability (2.27%). Impact: Policymakers should consider the role of external determinants in allocating VA resources to meet local demand.",1,,,,1,1,,,external to VA determinants of care utilization,1
20151100,Patient-experienced integrated care for veterans with multiple chronic conditions,"Integration remains a signature challenge for health care. Fragmentation limits health care systems' ability to provide the right care, at the right time, at reasonable cost. This fragmentation is driven by several factors, including the rapid expansion of medical knowledge and technology, and the related specialization among clinical professionals. These factors increase the number of hand-offs across organizational boundaries and geographic locations. In VA, major national redesign innovations such as Primary Care-Mental Health Integration (PC-MHI) and Patient-Aligned Care Teams (PACTs) have been initiated to promote integration across the boundaries of specialty, role, and physical location where information and patient hand-offs occur. The ultimate goal of these efforts is to enhance patient-centered care. However, the degree to which these integrating innovations at the structural and process level enhance the patient's experience of integrated care remains unknown. Objectives: The objectives of this study are to assess the extent to which veterans experience their care as integrated, and to identify the alterable organizational characteristics and specific care processes that promote patient-experienced integrated care. Methods: This is a mixed-methods study completed in two phases. In phase 1, we measured the extent of integrated care through patient and provider surveys, and administrative data from existing secondary databases. We then used patient, provider, PACT, and PC-MHI survey data to categorize sites by their level of patient-experienced integration (PEI) and provider perceptions of integration (based on PACT/PC-MHI implementation). Using these categorizations, we chose 8 sites to be included in phase 2: 2 high, 2 low, and 4 mixed based on patient and provider data. In phase 2, leadership, managers, and front-line staff at the eight selected sites were interviewed using semi-structured interview guides to identify organizational characteristics and care processes that influence care integration. In phase 1 we sent surveys to patients with diabetes and co-morbid conditions that differ on two dimensions--domain (physical/mental health-related) and severity (low/high)--and their providers. From these data we addressed the following questions: RQ1: how integrated is the care experienced by veterans with diabetes, and does experienced integration vary among patients given differences in co-morbidity domain and extent of specialty care involvement, as well as differences in other patient-level characteristics? RQ2: in addition to patient-level characteristics, what provider and organizational characteristics relate to higher and lower levels of PEI among patients with different co-morbidity domains and severity? Using phase 2 interviews and phase 1 survey data, we also addressed RQ3: what specific policies, relationships within and between departments/services, managerial practices, and/or staff behaviors constitute the structures and processes that produce higher levels of PEI? For quantitative data analysis we used multiple linear regression with hierarchical modeling (RQ1-2). For qualitative data analysis, we used iterative qualitative methods, including the constant comparative method (RQ3). Findings: Response rates for the provider and patient surveys were 30% and 49%, respectively. A total of 89 semi-structured interviews with providers across all eight sites were completed. Several themes emerged from ongoing coding of successes and challenges to integrated care. We found that patient-experienced integration is associated with strong PACT huddle practices, same-day access to mental health services, and strong medical center leadership (i.e., service chiefs and quadrad). Integration is generally strengthened by mental health providers, clinical pharmacists, and dieticians embedded in primacy care. Provider-experienced integration is associated with innovative PACT programs, and working to the top of license. Turnover, hiring, service agreements, and difficulties in the referral process were challenges in our previous primary care study in 2009 and remain serious challenges across sites. Impact: By identifying alterable organizational characteristics and specific care processes that promote patient-experienced integrated care, as well as by better understanding the extent to which veterans experience their care as integrated, VA may change policies and procedures to improve integrated, patient-centered care. This study has identified factors directly affecting integration, as well as nuances in their use that determine whether the practice is a facilitator or barrier to integration. For example, having service agreements between primary care and specialties can facilitate integration in the presence of trusting working relationships and good communication but can be a barrier when such relationships and communication are not present. Such additional information not only increases our understanding of the organizational practices but also provides a needed perspective to effectively implement improvements.",1,1,1,1,,,,,primary care and mental health integration in the VA,1
20153116,Developmental origins of children's cardiometabolic risk,"Cardiometabolic risk has reached epidemic levels among the poor and underserved, individually and across generations. For over three decades, both childhood and maternal obesity rates have steadily increased. There have been parallel increases in childhood-onset type 2 diabetes (DM), now detected as early as age 6, along with elevated levels of lipids and blood pressure requiring adult medication to control. A major knowledge gap remains in understanding how social and biological contexts combine to influence intergenerational cardiometabolic risk and disease. Closing this gap may lead to new interventions strongly grounded in scientific evidence about the human life course, starting preconception, and incorporating the entire family unit in a community context. This proposal aligns with MCHB Strategic Research Issue IV to promote healthy development of MCHB populations and Healthy People 2020 objectives to reduce childhood obesity (NWS-10) and prevent inappropriate weight gain (NWS-11). Our overarching theme is biological programming of the next generation's health begins preconception, closely linked to the mother's and father's physical and social well-being. Strongly guided by life course theory and our team's earlier findings, our proposed study is auxiliary to the multisite NIH-funded Community Child Health Network (CCHN). CCHN is the first prospective study starting prior to conception to measure maternal allostatic load, parental stress, and resilience factors, and the course of prenatal development and early childhood outcomes. The proposed follow-up sample (N=180) resides in Lake County, IL and Washington, DC. Families were followed from the birth of one child until a subsequent pregnancy. We collected additional biological and psychosocial data during that pregnancy, at 2 months postpartum, and then when the child was ages 3 and 4. We are requesting funds to conduct a follow-up set of assessments on the CCHN family sample of subsequently born children. For this application, we propose a new home visit when the children reach 5-6 years, to 1) update our longitudinal interviews with mothers and fathers; and 2) collect new information on their children's growth, including a formal assessment of their neurocognitive development at about the time they will be starting school. Further, we will obtain blood samples to quantify the children's physiological measures of cardiometabolic risk. Finally, we will 1) request and abstract the children's medical records from their primary health provider and other sources of care (only the maternity and newborn hospital record was previously requested by CCHN), and 2) conduct three phone calls each year to enhance retention and obtain interim data. The main hypotheses for this project are (hypothesis 1) children's cardiometabolic risk at 5 years will be significantly influenced by the mother's stress and her own cardiometabolic health prior to conception; and (hypothesis 2) children's intellectual competence will be significantly affected by maternal stress and cardiometabolic health prior to conception. We will also explore how father stress and cardiometabolic health contribute to their children's lives in a biopsychosocial, intergenerational health model. This exploratory study is particularly valuable given the unique nature of the parent study and the historical exclusion of fathers from much MCH research.",1,1,1,,,,,,biologic programming and family environment,1
20143173,Translating obesity and diabetes prevention into the worksite for immigrant populations,"Obesity and diabetes are serious health problems in the United States, with rapidly increasing prevalence and incidence over the last 10 years. National data document alarming increases in overweight and obesity, and among Latinos the prevalence is 78%, markedly higher than in the general population. An estimated 25.6 million people 20 years or older have diabetes in the U.S., with the greatest increases in prevalence among racial and ethnic minority populations, further complicated by disparities in socioeconomic status. Hispanics face a diabetes prevalence twice that of non-Hispanic whites and suffer higher rates of diabetes complications and mortality. Nationally, it is estimated that there are over 2.6 million hired farm workers in the U.S., and California is among the largest employers of these workers. In California, over 450,000 people are employed in agriculture, with more than two-thirds being of Latino ethnicity. Most are immigrants with low levels of education and many have Spanish as their only language. This population also faces issues with limited access to health care, compounded by poverty and low socioeconomic status. While intervention efforts have demonstrated that an intensive lifestyle approach promoting diet and physical activity can significantly reduce obesity and diabetes incidence, there continues to be a need for effective programs designed for underserved and immigrant populations--a sizeable proportion of the U.S. working population. The overall goal of this study is to validate the effectiveness of an obesity and diabetes intervention among low-literate immigrant farm workers. We propose that a lifestyle intervention delivered at the agricultural worksite will improve obesity and diabetes risk for employees and will prove to be cost-effective for the employer. The collaboration of established investigators at UC Davis with Reiter Affiliated Companies (RAC, a large berry grower in California) and the Health Initiative of the Americas at UC Berkeley (experts in organizing health campaigns for underserved immigrant populations) creates a unique opportunity to achieve significant positive health outcomes through a total worker health approach. Our efforts will build upon two successful pilot studies conducted with RAC and will enable us to reach a larger number of people and evaluate the program's translation and sustainability potential. Successful achievement of the project goals will enable dissemination of the program to improve the health of workers via a cost-effective and culturally tailored obesity and diabetes risk factor intervention.",1,1,,,,,,,lifestyle intervention for migrant farm workers,1
20184305,CREST-2 Statistical and Data Coordinating Center (SDCC),"The broad, long-term objective of this application is to advance primary prevention of stroke in patients at risk for stroke due to atherosclerosis of the carotid artery. Four to eight percent of adults have asymptomatic carotid stenosis exceeding 50%. Carotid stenosis is often managed either by endarterectomy or stenting. About 100,000 carotid endarterectomies and 40,000 carotid stenting procedures are done each year in the US. Up to 90% of these procedures are done on asymptomatic patients. Medical therapy has improved. The Asymptomatic Carotid Surgery Trial (ACST) demonstrated that medical management of hyperlipidemia can attenuate the benefits of revascularization in patients with asymptomatic stenosis. Further advances in managing atherosclerotic risk factors may negate benefit that might otherwise be realized through revascularization, making the morbidity of the procedures unjustifiable. Endarterectomy and stenting have also improved. The results for endarterectomy in CREST (Carotid Revascularization Endarterectomy vs. Stenting Trial) showed a periprocedural stroke and death rate of 1.4%. For stenting, the rate was the lowest yet reported in a randomized controlled trial, 2.5%, and that rate was improving in the last tertile of enrollment. We will conduct two parallel randomized, multicenter non-inferiority trials (CREST-2). The primary specific aims will be to compare the effectiveness of intensive medical management to carotid endarterectomy (n=1050) and also to compare the effectiveness of intensive medical management to stenting (n=1050) for patients with high-grade asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis. The primary endpoint will be a composite of any stroke or death within 30 days of randomization plus ipsilateral stroke up to 4 years of follow-up. Vascular risk factors, including hypertension, diabetes mellitus, cigarette smoking, and hyperlipidemia, will be managed centrally using modern aggressive targets. Should intensive medical management be declared non-inferior to endarterectomy, stenting or both, up to 5,000 periprocedural strokes may be prevented.",1,1,,,,,,,medical management of hyperlipidemia,1
20143061,Technologically enhanced coaching (TEC): a program for improving diabetes outcomes,"Background: Peer support among patients with diabetes has been found to be an effective intervention to address barriers to diabetes self-management; however, one potential limitation of peer support programs is that peer supporters by definition lack substantial medical and other content knowledge. To increase the potential impact of peer support programs, a key next step is to test whether providing peer supporters with evidence-based educational tools enhances the effectiveness of such programs. We thus developed a personally tailored, interactive diabetes medication and self-management e-health decision aid (iDecide). In a prior study, we found that low-income, urban Latino and African American adults with diabetes who worked with community health workers (CHWs) using iDecide had greater improvements with satisfaction and decreased diabetes distress. Since many health care systems in low-resource settings do not have trained CHWs or other outreach workers, it is important to investigate whether programs such as iDecide are helpful in assisting peer coaches. Accordingly, in the current study we conducted a trial in a low-resource health care system (Detroit VA Medical Center) testing the effectiveness of a peer coach-delivered iDecide intervention for patients with poor glycemic control. Objectives: The three main objectives of this randomized controlled trial were to 1) test the effectiveness of a technology-enhanced peer coaching program (iDecide arm) in improving glucose control relative to peer coaching without technology enhancement (Peer Support-Alone arm); 2) assess the impact of the intervention on key patient-centered outcomes, including patients' satisfaction and involvement with care, perceived social support, diabetes-specific quality of life, and medication adherence; and 3) identify patient characteristics associated with engagement in the intervention and mediators and moderators of the intervention's impact on patient outcomes. Methods: From September 2014 to September 2016, veterans with A1c > 8.0% were enrolled in a 6-month peer coaching intervention. Participants were randomized to either the iDecide arm or Peer Support-Alone arm, both consisting of an initial face-to-face coaching session followed by weekly phone calls to discuss behavioral goals. Veterans who had poor glycemic control in the past (A1c > 8.0%) but whose most recent A1c in the prior 6 months was < 8.0% were recruited as peer coaches. For peer coaches in both arms, we held a 2-hour initial training session that focused on key motivational interviewing-based communication skills and helping participants define a longer-term behavioral goal and specific short-term steps to reach that goal (""action planning""). Peer coaches in the iDecide arm participated in an additional 1-hour training session on how to navigate the iDecide tool that was delivered on iPads. The iDecide program consisted of four main sections: 1) information and illustrative animations on how diabetes affects how glucose is processed in the body and how different medication classes, foods, and physical activity act to affect blood sugar; 2) participants viewed their own risk of diabetes complications (tailored based upon their baseline A1c) and could interactively change their A1c levels and see in pictographs how this changed their risk of different complications; 3) participants reviewed their current diabetes medications and barriers to taking medications that they had identified on the baseline survey and engaged with an interactive ""issue card"" to help elicit their preferences and priorities in terms of different medication characteristics; and 4) participants were prompted to set goals, develop a specific action plan to address identified barriers or other concerns, and generate specific questions and concerns to discuss with their doctor. Participants were given the link to the iDecide program with their personal information for them to access at their convenience throughout the intervention period and encouraged to continue to access the program as needed. Findings: Of the 260 veterans enrolled, 255 participants (88%) completed 6-month assessments and 237 (82%) completed 12-month assessments. Ninety-eight percent were men, and 63% were African American. In the Peer Support-Alone group, mean baseline A1cs of 9.07% improved to 8.39% (-0.68%, p<0.001) at 6 months and remained 8.55% (-0.54, p=0.004) at 12 months. Mean baseline A1c in the iDecide group was 9.08% at baseline and improved to 8.38% (-0.70, p<0.001) at 6 months and remained 8.52% (-0.55, p=0.002) at 12 months. There were no significant between-group differences at 6-month or 12-month follow-up. There were no significant changes in systolic blood pressure at any time point in either group. Significant within-group improvements were observed in self-reported diabetes-specific social support in both groups between baseline and 6 months and between baseline and 12 months. Conclusion: Clinical gains achieved through a volunteer peer coach program were not increased by the addition of a tailored e-Health educational tool. Impact: This study is among the first efforts to respond to the call for the testing of e-health consumer health applications for use by nontraditional caregivers such as volunteer peer coaches with racial and ethnic minority and low-literate populations. Our study found that both peer support models were effective in improving A1c levels right after the interventions, and importantly, these gains were sustained 6 months after the programs' conclusion. The A1c improvements of >0.5% achieved at both 6 and 12 months in both intervention arms in this study are both statistically and clinically significant. A mean difference in A1c level of 0.5% translates into an absolute 2.8% risk reduction in diabetes events over 10 years. Of note, these clinically significant and sustained gains were not further improved through use of an e-health educational tool in the initial face-to-face visit and its availability to participants throughout the intervention period. This suggests that the ongoing supportive relationships between peer coaches and their assigned patients in both peer support arms were the most important active ingredient in the intervention's success. This is good news for resource-constrained health systems that may lack the capacity to develop, continually update, and manage tailored e-health programs. Volunteer peer support programs can be important complements to over-burdened formal health care providers to improve the frequency and intensity of ongoing support between face-to-face clinic visits. Unlike most other tested diabetes management support programs, gains achieved over the 6-month intervention period were sustained 6 months after the end of the program. Moreover, such programs that mobilize patients to help other patients could realistically be provided over sustained periods of time.",1,,1,,,,,,peer support/coaching,1
20143119,Multi-clinic action trial to control hyperglycemia and hypertension,"Compared to non-Hispanic whites, Hispanics and African Americans with type 2 diabetes experience lower rates of control of risk factors (glucose, blood pressure, lipids), and higher rates of end-organ complications. To address these disparities, new models of primary care are needed. The use of community health workers (CHWs) has been advocated as one approach, and preliminary research findings have been encouraging. The MATCH randomized controlled trial tested the impact of behavioral self-management coaching delivered in participants' homes by CHWs over a two-year period in a community setting. This rigorous phase III efficacy trial demonstrated that the MATCH intervention was effective in producing a sustained improvement in hemoglobin A1c in a Mexican American population. Participants in the intervention arm had a mean reduction of A1c levels of 0.48 from baseline at the end of year 1 (p=0.021) and an even greater decrease of 0.72 two years post-randomization (p=0.005); the attention control group showed no change. Although mean arterial blood pressure improved relative to control at one year, this improvement was not sustained. The proposed MATCH2 Study (The Multi-clinic Action Trial to Control Hyperglycemia and Hypertension) will test an optimized intervention building on the MATCH protocol in which CHWs will be integrated into the primary care team at three urban safety clinics. A community-based participatory research approach will be used to adapt the CHW intervention to the clinic setting, and to enhance the ability of CHWs to work effectively with health disparity populations of different races/ethnicities. Web-based communications will allow CHWs in participants' homes to rapidly update providers in the clinic. The intervention curriculum has also been strengthened, emphasizing self-monitoring, diet, and physical activity, with increased emphasis on blood pressure as well as glucose. The RCT will test if this optimized intervention, compared to a lower intensity group educational program, can reduce both hemoglobin A1c levels (specific aim 1), and blood pressure (aim 2) at eighteen months in persons with uncontrolled diabetes (A1c >7.0 at baseline). Follow-up six months after the completion of the intervention will evaluate the sustainability of any gains (aim 3). Use of more precise measures of diet (food frequency questionnaires) and physical activity (accelerometry) will seek to identify intermediate behaviors and processes that mediate significant improvements in glycemic and blood pressure control in the MATCH CHW intervention (aim 4). Finally, all costs borne by both the program and the participant will be documented, in order to evaluate costs and benefits (aim 5). By building on and strengthening the MATCH intervention, the overarching goal of this study is to set the stage for a multi-center effectiveness trial to determine the external validity and replicability of the CHW model in reducing health disparities.",1,,1,,,,,,adapt CHW intervention to clinic,1
20143386,Integrating My HealtheVet (MHV) and patient-aligned care teams for self-management support,"Background: The VA population is disproportionately affected by diabetes and while most studies report a strong role for patient self-management in promoting optimal diabetes control, current evidence suggests sub-optimal self-management practices among diabetic patients. Internet and electronic diabetes interventions, including decision provider support mechanisms and patient accessible patient health record systems, have been demonstrated to improve chronic care in primary care settings. Additionally, group medical appointments (GMA) for diabetes management are being recognized as an effective clinical encounter method for diabetes care. Few studies have explored the integration of interactive patient health record systems (PHR) and group diabetes visits. The Veterans Administration (VA) is uniquely suited for exploring the feasibility of such a system because of its robust PHR (My HealtheVet), over 10-year experience implementing GMAs and unique VA-wide implementation of the patient-centered medical home (PCMH) model called patient-aligned care teams (PACT) since 2010. Objectives: This study aims to develop a Diabetes Virtual Group Medical Access (D-VGMA) intervention for primary care PACT diabetes patients who opted-in for secure messaging (SM). We will secondarily evaluate the effectiveness of D-VGMA in improving self-management practices and diabetes outcomes among selected participants. Methods: This study was conducted in distinct phases that focus on a) the development of a reference toolkit and guide for implementation of the D-VGMA intervention using existing evidence-based educational materials, individualized PACT team with patient SM communications, and formative patient- and provider-centered review processes; b) preliminary and full implementation of the D-VGMA intervention among a cohort of patient from a Loma Linda VA (LL-VA) academic primary care team (Academic PACT or APACT); and c) evaluation of the impact of the D-VGMA intervention on diabetes self-management practices (main outcome), and diabetes knowledge and self-efficacy (secondary outcomes). We will also explore the impact of the intervention on standardized clinical diabetes outcome, including A1c, LDL-C, and BP. The evaluation design will utilize a prospective cohort design using a repeated test approach. Participants in the evaluation study were selected using specific eligibility criteria and recruited through appropriate selection, consent, and recruitment procedures. Data collection will be conducted using standardized data collection tools and data analysis will explore the primary hypothesis that the intervention will result in a statistically significant improvement in self-management practices in addition to other secondary outcomes. A program evaluation survey was also conducted. Findings: The main interventional portion of the study has been completed. Fourteen patients were enrolled for the pilot phase of the study and an additional 78 patients were enrolled for the expanded rollout phase which has been completed. Overall, there were 2 drop-outs from the pilot phase and 25 drop-outs from the expanded phase. A post-study evaluation questionnaire conducted via phone on 34 of the remaining 65 patients being tracked revealed that 14 of the participants did not complete any modules, 11 completed all modules, and 9 completed some but not all. Seventeen had a very positive impression of the program, 11 had a somewhat positive impression, 4 were neutral, and 2 did not complete the entire questionnaire. Twenty-five very much would recommend the program, 3 somewhat would recommend, 4 were neutral, and 2 did not complete. Twenty-one very much would participate in another, 6 somewhat would participate in another, 2 were neutral, 2 would not participate, 1 somewhat would not participate, and 2 did not complete. The remaining data analysis portion of the study on key outcome measures is still in progress. Impact: It is anticipated that findings from this study will result in the overall improvement in the quality of diabetes care among affected individuals. If the D-VGMA intervention is demonstrated to be effective in improving self-management, self-efficacy, diabetes knowledge, and clinical outcomes, we anticipate systemwide dissemination of D-VGMA. Procedures from this study may also inform similar future virtual interventions aimed at other chronic medical conditions. No updates on impact are fully available as of the final report, as data analysis is currently ongoing. Post-study program evaluation showed favorable results for general impressions, acceptance, and usability of program.",1,,1,1,,,,,group medical appoitments and integration of patient health record systems,1
20153010,Diabetes self-management education and associated healthcare use in U.S. adults,"Addressing the epidemic of uncontrolled type 2 diabetes mellitus in the United States (US) is a top public health priority. More than 25.6 million adults have type 2 diabetes, and 45% of patients have inadequate glycemic control. Every year, poorly controlled diabetes is responsible for $58 billion in medical expenditures. Vulnerable populations including racial and ethnic minorities and individuals living in poverty typically have the highest rates of inadequate glycemic control, often resulting in avoidable and costly healthcare utilization. As such, the U.S. health care system urgently needs to improve diabetes management, particularly for vulnerable populations. Diabetes self-management education is known to improve the self-care behaviors of individuals. Increasingly, individuals with diabetes have access to diabetes self-management education in primary care settings, group classes, and over the internet and telephone, yet disparities persist. To date, it is unknown whether vulnerable populations in the U.S. have equal access to diabetes self-management education compared to other less vulnerable adults with type 2 diabetes. In addition, it is unclear whether vulnerable populations with access to diabetes self-management education have similar diabetic outcomes, health care utilization, and/or medical expenditures to other less vulnerable adults with type 2 diabetes. Therefore, in a nationally representative, population-based study the specific aims of this research are 1) to describe receipt of diabetes self-management education in racial and ethnic minorities and individuals living in poverty with type 2 diabetes, compared to other adults with type 2 diabetes; 2) to determine the extent to which receipt of diabetes self-management education mediates or moderates race/ethnicity and income-related disparities in hemoglobin A1c, blood pressure, and cholesterol; and 3) to determine the extent to which receipt of diabetes self-management education mediates or moderates race/ethnicity- and income-related disparities in diabetes-related health care utilization and medical expenditures. This study is directly in line with the mission of National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive Kidney Disease to support research on diabetes to improve people's health and quality of life. Ultimately, this research will identify important points of intervention for the delivery and effectiveness of diabetes self-management education. This research will be carried out as part of a broader training program characterized by (a) a highly motivated MD-PhD applicant who has demonstrated excellence in the pursuit of a degree in the academically rigorous, multidisciplinary field of population health sciences; (b) exceptional research training and mentoring by co-sponsors Dr. Elizabeth Jacobs and Dr. John Mullahy; (c) a world-class institutional environment, including a MD/PhD program with a distinguished track record of successfully training clinician-investigators; (d) outstanding opportunities for clinical experience in internal medicine; and (e) a well-thought out program of learning, research, and clinical experiences that will serve to train the applicant to be an independent and productive physician-scientist.",1,1,,,,,,,race/ethnic differences in receipt of daibetes self management education,1
20162341,"Medication adherence, health literacy and cultural health beliefs in a Massachusetts community health center","Health literacy, broadly defined as ""the wide range of skills and competencies"" that people use to manage their health (Zarcadoolas, et al. 2005, 196-197), is an important aspect of chronic disease self-management (Mancuso and Rincon 2006), though it has been inconsistently associated with medication adherence in multiple studies. While researchers continue to investigate the relationships among health literacy, medication adherence, and health outcomes, few have successfully integrated individual-level factors, such as health literacy, with structural and social factors. In the proposed research, we rely on ethnographic and qualitative data, in combination with quantitative methods, to explore how medication adherence, a widespread problem in chronic disease management, is shaped by structural factors such as insurance copays, as well as by cultural health beliefs. Building on our previous research (Shaw, et al. 2012a, Shaw, et al. 2009b), the proposed study examines health literacy, health beliefs, and barriers to medication adherence among patients from five ethnic groups (African American, Hispanic, white, Vietnamese and Russian immigrant). We base this study in Massachusetts, which has recently expanded the number of people insured under publicly funded programs while implementing cost-control measures that may limit access to prescription medications, especially for the poor. Drawing on self-report surveys, pill counts, chart review, in-depth interviews, and other qualitative methods, this study will meet the following specific aims: 1. using two different quantitative methods, to assess medication adherence among patients from 5 ethnic groups: (African American, Hispanic, white, and Vietnamese and Russian immigrants) with chronic disease (hypertension, diabetes, or dyslipidemia); 2. to use qualitative and ethnographic methods to explore the chronic disease health beliefs that may combine with health literacy to shape medication adherence; 3. to identify factors associated with medication adherence among patients with low health literacy, including a. beliefs about medicines, b. food insecurity, c. socioeconomic factors (e.g., type of health insurance coverage; formulary changes), and d. social support; and 4. to develop recommendations for primary care providers and policymakers to improve medication adherence and mitigate formulary changes among low-income patients with chronic illness. The unique constellation of conditions in Massachusetts--of near-universal insurance coverage coupled with stringent cost-control measures as the state struggles to balance its budget--offers an unmatched research opportunity and serves as a critical bellwether for coming changes facing other states with the advent of the Affordable Care Act. The diverse population of patients served by Caring Health Center, the proposed research site, provides a natural laboratory in which to explore the effects of these policy changes as they intersect with culturally variable health beliefs to shape medication adherence among urban, minority, and low-income patients. Improved understanding of these complex dynamics will better prepare primary health care providers to improve adherence and help reduce stroke risk among patients with hypertension and other chronic conditions.",1,1,1,,1,,,,health literacy for med adherence,1
20143588,Advancing stated-preference methods for measuring the preferences of patients with type 2 diabetes,"Patient-centered outcomes research (PCOR) helps patients and stakeholders make informed health care decisions, allowing their voices to be heard in assessing the value of health care options, but information on what patients and stakeholders value is often lacking. The values of patients and stakeholders can be identified by actively engaging them through consultation or by applying stated-preference methods to measure their priorities and preferences. Although both approaches are important, stated-preference methods have several advantages. They can incorporate both qualitative and quantitative methods and they can be used with large, diverse populations, including hard-to-reach patients and stakeholders. The validity, reliability, and generalizability of the findings of stated preference studies can be assessed. Finally, the preferences of different sub-groups can be compared and groups of individuals with similar preferences can be identified and described. Our proposal focuses on advancing and disseminating methods for patient and community engagement in PCOR and has three objectives. First, we will demonstrate good practices for patient and community involvement in PCOR projects by applying principles of community-based participatory research (CBPR). Second, we will address several key methodological questions pertaining to the use of stated-preference methods. As outlined in the specific aims, these include identifying the best methods for identifying patient priorities (aim 1), the best method for designing preference studies (aim 2), and strategies for analyzing variation in preferences (aim 3). We also seek to assess the relevance of stated-preference methods to patients and stakeholders (aim 4). Third, we will demonstrate good practices for applying stated-preference methods by studying the priorities and preferences of patients with type 2 diabetes. Type 2 diabetes was chosen because it is a chronic disease that requires meaningful patient involvement to improve outcomes. Type 2 diabetes affects 25.8 million people (8.3%) in the U.S. and disproportionately affects African American and Latino populations. While type 2 diabetes provides an important case study, our research will advance approaches and methods that will be broadly generalizable to other diseases, and to diverse patient and stakeholder groups. To facilitate the dissemination of our findings, we have engaged a local community board and a national diabetes advisory panel who will be engaged via regular meetings, a quarterly newsletter and a project website. Our dissemination plan will focus on the dissemination of lay explanations of our methods and results and document case studies of our patient/community engagement and application of stated-preference methods to type 2 diabetes.

20143110,VA diabetes prevention: enhanced implementation evaluation,"Background: Multiple large-scale randomized controlled trials have shown that in people with impaired glucose tolerance, 40-60% of type 2 diabetes cases can be prevented with lifestyles interventions that emphasize diet, exercise, and weight loss. Despite the strong evidence base supporting preventability, the incidence of diabetes continues to increase. VA MOVE! does not specifically target those with pre-diabetes. Most veterans referred to VA MOVE! who do not already have a diagnosis of diabetes do not know if they are pre-diabetic. With a few exceptions, lifestyle modification interventions that target individuals with pre-diabetes and follow the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) curriculum are not available to veterans with pre-diabetes in the VA. This project builds on two concurrent projects, the VA Diabetes Prevention clinical demonstration project funded by our partners at VA National Center for Health Promotion and Disease Prevention (NCP) and the QUERI funded RRP titled: VA Diabetes Prevention: Epidemiology of Pre-Diabetes and Implementation Pilot. Objectives: The overarching goal of this proposal is to provide our clinical partner, NCP, with evidence to guide future implementation of diabetes prevention strategies in the VA. The specific aims of this study are to (1) test an implementation strategy and identify barriers and facilitators to implementation of the VA-DPP demonstration project at three VA medical centers using a mixed-methods approach that is informed by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) and Reach Effectiveness Adoption Implementation Maintenance (RE-AIM) frameworks; (2) test for mediation of intervention effect on weight loss by constructs that are addressed differently in VA MOVE! and VA-DPP including group cohesion, intervention intensity, outcome expectations, goal awareness and commitment, and self-regulation skills; and (3) conduct cost-effectiveness and budget impact analyses of implementing the VA-DPP broadly in the VA from the perspective of the health system. Methods: This was a hybrid type 3 mixed-methods implementation evaluation project. Veterans referred to the VA MOVE! program at three VA medical centers were screened for the VA-DPP clinical demonstration project between August 2012 and January 2014. Veterans who had a HbA1c of 5.7-6.4 or a fasting plasma glucose of 100-125ml, lived within 60 minutes of the VAMC, and met additional inclusion criteria were assigned to the VA-DPP or MOVE! program using a systematic sampling approach. Participants were invited to complete surveys at baseline and 12 months. Medical records data were used to evaluate participation and health outcomes, and conduct a cost-effectiveness analyses. Qualitative data were elicited through interviews with a subset of participants. Additionally, staff interviews pre- and post-implementation were conducted and coded using the CFIR and RE-AIM implementation framework to inform implementation and to guide development of implementation strategies for future dissemination. A total of 1850 patients were screened and/or attended a MOVE! orientation session at one of three VAMCs and were assessed for eligibility. Among these, 387 individuals met all eligibility criteria; 273 were assigned to the VA-DPP program and 114 were assigned to the MOVE! program. Among the 273 participants assigned to VA-DPP, 36% (n=98) explicitly declined to participate. However, our weight analyses at 6 and 12 months included all VA-DPP assigned participants consistent with an intent-to-treat (ITT) analytic approach. One patient who did not have a baseline weight assessment was excluded, leaving a final analytic weight sample of 386 participants (VA-DPP n=273, MOVE! n=113). For HbA1c outcomes assessment, patients were excluded who did not have a baseline HbA1c or FPG within six months of enrollment (n=6) and participants who did not complete a follow-up HbA1c test (n=71), leaving a final analytic HgA1c sample of 310 participants (VA-DPP n=210, MOVE! n=100). Findings: Participants were mostly middle-aged with an average HbA1c of 6.0% and co-morbid hypertension. All baseline characteristics were comparable between study arms except for race/ethnicity. MOVE! program participants had a higher percentage of Hispanics and lower proportions of African Americans and Caucasians (p=0.04). Participants were representative of the VHA population (overweight/obese males) and also reflected the racial/ethnic diversity at the three VAMCs included in this trial. Participation rates were higher in the VA-DPP program over the 12 months. In the first 6 months, 88.3% of VA-DPP participants and 84% of MOVE! participants completed at least one session of their respective program and 55.0% and 42.4%, respectively, completed at least four sessions. Based on adjusted outcomes within groups, participants in the VA-DPP had statistically significant weight loss at 6 and 12 months but MOVE! program participants did not. There were significant differences in predicted weight change between arms at 6 months (MOVE! -1.9 kg vs. VA-DPP -4.1kg, p<0.001) but not at 12 months (MOVE! -2.0 vs. VA-DPP -3.4kg, p=0.16). After controlling for covariates, HbA1c at 12 months did not show significant changes from baseline, and no difference was found in the predicted HbA1c change at 12 months by study arm (MOVE! 0.06 vs. VA-DPP -0.02, p=0.34). The quality of coaching, reflected by fidelity ratings for coach characteristics, was rated highly for both programs. However, VA-DPP had higher fidelity ratings for four domains of program delivery. Thus, though session leaders for both programs tended to come ""prepared and organized,"" the programs differed in many other ways, e.g., more ""positive relationships among the group members"" in VA-DPP than MOVE!. Additionally, VA-DPP participants reported higher satisfaction for six of eight items related to their program. Together, these differences may partially explain weight loss differences, and perhaps more importantly the higher rates of continued engagement of VA-DPP participants. Multi-faceted strategies are needed to successfully reach targeted patients and to implement and maintain the DPP in a clinical setting. Impact: Implementation of the VA-DPP demonstration program has the potential to significantly improve health outcomes for veterans by delaying or preventing the onset of type 2 diabetes. The research component of the VA-DPP contributed to our knowledge about the incidence of pre-diabetes in veterans; their attitudes and beliefs about diet, exercise, and weight loss; and understanding how different programs may impact weight loss. Preliminary VA-DPP data provided important and relevant information to NCP who updated MOVE! group visit guidance to align more closely with the DPP's curriculum for all veterans, not just those with pre-diabetes. This work, along with other projects, also helped lead to our newly funded MOVE! LEAP project as part of our new PRoVE QUERI program.",1,1,1,,,,,,testing the implementation of VA MOVE intervention,1
20143385,Evaluating the Navajo Community Outreach and Patient Empowerment (COPE) program,"Chronic health problems such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and diabetes are much more common among American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) individuals, compared to all other racial/ethnic groups. Since 2009, Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH), the Navajo Nation Community Health Representative Program (NNCHR), and Navajo Area IHS have worked together to create a program that focuses on helping people with these health problems who reside on the Navajo reservation in rural Arizona and New Mexico. COPE (Community Outreach and Patient Empowerment) promotes increased health knowledge and healthy lifestyles among individuals and families, while concurrently facilitating access to good health care services. COPE works in four areas, including 1) improving coordination between community health representatives and clinic providers; 2) improving CHR teaching skills through standardized training; 3) home-based, culturally sensitive teaching materials for patients and families; and 4) strong community health representative supervision. COPE started in two of the hospitals in Navajo Nation, and will expand to six more hospitals by 2016 in a stepwise fashion. This planned expansion provides an opportunity to understand if COPE is having a positive impact on people's lives. The goal of our research is to answer these questions: 1) Does the COPE project improve the health of patients who participate? 2) Does the COPE project empower patients, providing an increased sense of control over their lives and their health-related decisions? 3) What are the key ingredients to the success of the COPE Project? 4) How do other stakeholders (providers, community health representatives, and policy makers of health care systems) view COPE? Our proposal responds to PCORI's Addressing Disparities funding announcement by promoting a culturally appropriate, systems-level approach to an extremely vulnerable population of rural American Indians, who collectively suffer from high rates of chronic disease and poor health outcomes. Our existing team includes researchers, clinical providers, and community members, and uses community-based participatory methods to ensure that our research is driven by the community's own priorities.",1,1,1,1,,,,,"home based teaching for patients and familiares, linking to health clinics/orgs",1
20152723,Evaluation of glycemic over- and under-treatment indicators for high-risk veterans,"Background: One in four veterans have diabetes, of whom 40% are 60-69 years of age (the Vietnam era cohort); and about 25% are over 70 years of age. Serious co-morbid conditions are common (31%) even in younger (< 65 years) veterans. About one in five veterans > 65 years have cognitive impairment or dementia, and about 30% have an estimated glomerular filtration rate of < 60 ml/min/1.73m2. About 30% of veterans receive insulin, and use of basal insulin has increased by 41% since 2008. Recent American Diabetes Association Guidelines agree with VHA-DoD Diabetes Guidelines that target values should be individualized based upon factors such as life expectancy, comorbid conditions, patient preferences, and risk for serious hypoglycemia. However, the current National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA) < 7% A1c measure for persons less than 65 years of age neither stratifies by insulin nor excludes serious non-diabetes-related or mental co-morbid conditions. The NCQA < 8% A1c measure applicable to persons 65 to 74 years of age has no exclusion criteria. There is also no recommendation to assess glycemic management in individuals with diabetes > 75 years of age. Due to these concerns, VHA only tracks A1c > 9% (poor control). This gap led the DM-QUERI R&M Committee to recommend development of clinical indicators for potential over- and under-treatment of glycemic control as a key strategic goal. Based upon our published work (continuous measures, glycemic regimen complexity and co-morbid conditions), we will work in partnership with VACO partners to refine and evaluate such indicators. Concurrent with the funding of the RRP, the draft (now final) Department of Health and Human Services National Action Plan for Prevention of Adverse Drug Events stated: ""Specifically, the [NQF measures] do not exclude patients for whom HbA1c < 8 percent would be inappropriate according to new guidelines, or stratify by medications (such as insulin). Neither do they address potential overtreatment in high-risk groups."" The investigators conceptualized that rather than separate measures for undertreatment and overtreatment, that a composite measure of in range (IR), which is guideline concordant, and out of range (OOR), defined as the current 9% poor control and the < 7% overtreatment level, would better convey appropriate treatment in the elderly. Objectives: The long-term objective of this proposal is to improve the appropriateness of glycemic management. Our specific aims are (1) to develop technical specifications for clinical indicators of under- and over-treatment; a) to evaluate the impact of different inclusion and exclusion criteria on measure performance characteristics (e.g., sensitivity and specificity); b) to work with our VACO Program Office partners to finalize measure specification; (2) to assess variation at various VA organizational levels (CBOCs, facilities, and VISNS); and 3) to work with our VACO Program Office partners to develop clinical indicators for over- and under-treatment that can be utilized to inform quality improvement, surveillance, and direct patient care. Methods: Using the CDW outpatient, medication, and laboratory files, we identified the denominator of patients at high risk for hypoglycemia as having: received insulin (I) or sulfonylurea (SU) in FY 2012; age 65 or greater; last serum creatinine 2.0 mg/dl; ICD-9CM diagnosis of cognitive impairment (CI)/dementia; and at least one A1c in FY 2013. The patient-level outcomes were the percentage of patients with A1c < 7%, < 8%, > 9%, OOR (< 7% or > 9%), and IR (7.5%-8.5%) stratified by 65-75 years and 75+ years. The facility-level outcomes were the facility rankings correlation of dichotomous measures with OOR and IR (Spearman's Rank correlation coefficient). Changes in facility-level percentile rankings of facilities in the top and bottom two deciles based on the < 8% were compared to rankings based upon OOR measure. Findings: We identified 435,078 patients on I/SU, of whom 112,541 (25.8%) met the inclusion criteria at 130 facilities (average number of patients: 866; range 110-3,518). The average age was 78.5 years; 98.8% were male; 64.3% were married; 25.5% were poor; and 50.2% were disabled. The A1c was out of range (OOR) in 44.1% of patients: OT (< 7%) in 31.6% of patients, UT (> 9%) in 12.5%. Only 30.4% were in the range recommended by ADA (A1c 7.5-8.5%). The OOR measure ranged from 33.2% in the best performing decile (of the 130 facilities) to 56.8% in the worst performing decile. The ranges for OT and UT alone in best and worst performing deciles were 20.9%-49.1% and 7.5%-19.4%, respectively. Facility rankings for OT or UT were poorly correlated. Regarding facility rankings, 16 of 26 worse performing facilities (bottom 2 deciles) improved to higher deciles; 20/26 (77%) of best performing (top 2 deciles) worsened to lower deciles. Conclusions: We conclude that nearly half of our study population of elderly or ill patients, most of whom would not be included in current HEDIS measures, were OT or UT, and therefore at risk for short-term harms. Among older/sicker patients on sulfonylurea and/or insulin, over-treatment (< 7%) is 2.2-fold more common than under-treatment (> 9%). There was significant facility-level variation, and even the best performers had more than a third of high-risk patients with OOR A1c. There was marked facility-level variation. Impact: We recommend replacing the current < 8% measure with an OOR measure that more appropriately focuses physician action and better reflects ""patient safety."" Additionally, an in-range (IR) interval measure can guide quality improvement efforts consistent with current guidelines and the limitations in the precision of the A1c test from clinical laboratories.",1,,,,,,1,,specifications for a1c control in the VA/quality metrics,1

20143382,Improving health outcomes among Native Americans with diabetes and cardiovascular disease,"Project background: American Indians and Alaska Natives (AI/ANs) have the highest prevalence of diabetes among all U.S. racial and ethnic groups. In fiscal year (FY) 2010, the diabetes prevalence among AI/AN adults who obtained services through Indian Health Service (IHS) was 14.6%, nearly double the U.S. rate. Compared to other racial groups, AI/ANs are more likely to develop type 2 diabetes at younger ages and to have more diabetes-related complications. These factors substantially increase diabetes-related mortality. Although diabetes is the seventh leading cause of death in the U.S., it ranks fourth among AI/ANs. Heart disease is the leading cause of AI/AN mortality and a common complication among those with diabetes. AI/ANs have the highest rate of premature deaths from heart disease among all races; that is, they are more likely to die from heart disease before age 65 than other races. To address this need, IHS and tribes collaborated with the Centers for American Indian and Alaska Native Health (CAIANH) to create a project data set from existing data sources, which are stored in different computer systems, to increase their capability to evaluate health services. We propose to use these data, and the collaborations we developed as part of the previous project, for this study. Project goal: The project goal is to provide information that may be used to improve health outcomes among AI/AN adults with diabetes and CVD. Project methods: The study population includes approximately 14,600 AI/AN adults with diabetes and CVD who use IHS services and lived in 15 project sites during FY2012. The data infrastructure includes data for FY2011-2012. Building on existing collaborations, we will create a Collaborative Network that includes CAIANH, IHS and tribal health program representatives, and patients to provide advice and guidance on all aspects of the study. Patients will provide input on all study activities. First, we will conduct analyses to better understand the patients' needs. These will include analyses of health status, service use, and treatment costs. Second, we will conduct a study to evaluate how use of education, case management, and advanced practice pharmacy services influences patient outcomes. The Collaborative Network will identify which patient outcomes should be studied. They may include health status outcomes based on clinical measures (e.g., blood pressure, glycemic, and cholesterol levels) and health care quality outcomes such as preventable use of inpatient services and hospital readmissions. Finally, the Collaborative Network will use these findings to identify strategies that may facilitate patients' ability to make informed choices about using education, case management, and advanced practice pharmacy services, and enhance the provision of these services to better address patients' needs.",1,1,,1,,,,,identify patient factors that influence diabetes and CVD health outcomes,1
20143389,Impact of patient navigators on health education and quality of life in formerly incarcerated patients,"Background: In January of 2008, nearly 2.3 million people were either currently or formerly incarcerated, representing an estimated 1 in every 100 adults in the United States. As of January 2011, an estimated 56,000 individuals in NYC were under custody: the majority were male (96%), on average 37 years old, black (51%), and first felony offenders (65%). Chronic medical conditions such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes have been reported in nearly a quarter of the prison population with a high risk of mortality during the transition period of re-entry into the community. Recognizing the need for successful re-entry and linkage into care, St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital's Center for Comprehensive Care (SLRH CCC) established the Coming Home Program (CHP) in 2006. CHP has since served more than 1400 patients with many linked to care within one month of release. Objectives: The primary specific aim of the study is to examine the effectiveness of using patient navigators to improve health education impact (heiQ) and quality of life (HRQOL-14) in formerly incarcerated individuals. Secondary aims are to examine the effectiveness of using patient navigators in improving health care utilization and medical outcomes. Methods: This is a three-year prospective randomized comparative study of the efficacy of patient navigation on health education, health-related quality of life, health care utilization, and medical outcomes in formerly incarcerated individuals. CHP patients at SLRH CCC will be recruited and screened for the study. Individuals will be randomized to the patient-navigator intervention or to a care-as-usual control condition (automated appointment reminder phone calls). Primary outcomes will be measures of health education impact (heiQ) and health related quality of life (HRQOL-14). Secondary outcomes will be measures of health care utilization and chronic medical disease management (blood pressure control, trends in HgbA1c, and CD4 and HIV RNA in the HIV-infected). A total of 300 recently incarcerated individuals will be enrolled with 150 subjects each in the intervention and usual care group. Patient outcomes (projected): This proposal responds to the PCORI call for addressing disparities as it will provide evidence for strategies to link and engage formerly incarcerated individuals into care, including: 1) do patient navigators improve the health education impact and quality of life of the individual and 2) do patient navigators improve patient health care utilization and self-management of chronic diseases. We hypothesize that the intervention will improve health education, health-related quality of life, adherence to clinical appointments, glycemic/blood pressure control, and virologic suppression in the HIV-infected. The results of this study will demonstrate interventions to eliminate health disparities in a highly marginalized group going through the transitional phase of re-entry into the community.",1,,1,,,,,1,patient navigators - could also be organizational? ,1
